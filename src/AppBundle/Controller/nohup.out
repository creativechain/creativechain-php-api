DESCRIPTION :Throughout our lives, we often inspire undue stress and anxiety by viewing our existence with a &ldquo;dualistic mind.&rdquo; We create a world of private duality, a world that is limited to fixed or black and white thinking. We do this because it gives us a (false) sense of security and control over life&rsquo;s uncertainties. The dualistic mind tricks us into thinking we have this &ldquo;life&rdquo; thing figured out, and we don&rsquo;t have to struggle and search anymore.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

"Slowly Rising" suggested to me the image of the sun.

A seed was born beneath the sun, the source of all existence.
The seed absorbed the light. It created more seeds like itself, gradually increasing in number.

Time passed, but still their numbers slowly continued to rise,
and before long they were quietly swallowed up by their own shadows.

After everything that had lived had perished, nothing but an empty world remained.
There, once again, an environment where the next living things could grow silently began to spread.

DESCRIPTION :Planet Under Pressure: a new climate security agenda.

Larger and richer populations are increasing the pressure on natural resources, further exacerbated by the immediate problem of a changing climate, with serious impacts on water, energy, and food security.&nbsp;The close interdependencies between water, energy and food are multiplying these threats&nbsp;in diverse countries and regions demonstrating that&nbsp;climate security will be an issue for all.&nbsp;An integrated 'nexus approach' is helping decision-makers to&nbsp;manage shared resources and achieve truly sustainable development. &nbsp;

&lsquo;Planet Under Pressure&rsquo; is the second film Moth Collective has produced for the Global Canopy Programme, a tropical forest think tank working to demonstrate the scientific, political and business&nbsp;case for safeguarding tropical forests as natural capital.

TITLE :My Brother
AUTHOR :Audrey Yeo
LICENSE :Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs License
YEAR :01/01/1970
DESCRIPTION :&ldquo;My Brother&rdquo; is a personal tribute to the silent contributions of migrant workers globally. I grew up in the island city-state of Singapore, where encounters with migrants of countries as diverse as Bangladesh, Myanmar, China and the Philippines are part of everyday living. Many of them take on jobs that are considered by the larger public to be menial in nature. Sometimes, the differences in our cultures and socioeconomic statuses cause social friction. When we allow this to be left unchecked, it can evolve into darker displays of xenophobic behavior.

But the inability to see past differences is not just a local issue; it is an increasingly global one. From where I am now in the United States, I am beginning to see how irresponsible political rhetoric, among other factors, influences previously big-hearted populations, populations which embraced &ndash; indeed championed &ndash; diversity. 
My response to this wave of sentiments is inspired by a quote I came across recently, attributed to the French composer Claude Debussy: music is the silence between the notes. The project aims to recognize the silent migrant workers&rsquo; contributions to our communities and celebrate their music between our notes.

&ldquo;My Brother&rdquo; is thus a metaphor for the thousands of underappreciated migrant workers we come across during our daily commute. I believe that bridges are built on bricks of commonalities and so the focus of this project is on the spaces of our shared humanity &ndash; school, families and personal dreams. 

After viewing the video, it is my personal hope that you make my brother, your brother too.

DESCRIPTION :A journey across the stars and heavens through antiquated astronomical diagrams.

I unearthed some dusty old scientific textbooks in my father&rsquo;s attic, and immediately became inspired by the delicately rendered diagrams, plots and schemata. These purely scientific visual aids became unwitting artworks on their own, which is something I really loved.

The short animation explores pathways through astronomy&rsquo;s roots, dating back to antiquity with its origins in scientific, mythological and astrological practices.

The soundtrack is 'Frosti' by Bjork, from the incredible album 'Vespertine'.

TITLE :New York Biotopes

YEAR :01/01/1970
DESCRIPTION :My bachelor graduation project &bdquo;New York Biotopes&ldquo; deals with abstract plants and creatures, which change their forms because of insufficient living space and adapt themselves to the surroundings of the metropolis New York City. A type of metamorphosis, where the newly developed vegetation assimilates elements of the city and makes them useful for their own purposes. These creatures and plants, partly mechanical, partly organically in appearance, spread more and more over the city and fill it up with life.

My idea was to create a film, that fills up the metropolis New York with vegetation, that adapts to the straightness of the technology and the given situation. This happens through the assimilation of structures and forms. These biotopes are shaped by the existing living environment, but in turn also shape the newly developed living environment by their presence. In other words, a symbiotically coexistence begins.

See our press release below for a short explanation.

Unfortunately the exhibition at MOTI Museum has ended. Hope you got to see it. It was HUGE and AWESOME! But don't worry, it will pop up again somewhere. Until then, enjoy the online version.

Official Press Release:

PARADISE, a contemporary interpretation of The Garden of Earthly Delights

Studio Smack, best known for their music video Witch Doctor by De Staat, have released a new animation: a contemporary interpretation of one of the most famous paintings by the Early Dutch master Hieronymus Bosch, The Garden of Earthly Delights.

In their latest work, the group cleared the original landscape of the middle panel of Bosch&rsquo;s painting and reconstructed it into a hallucinatory 4K animation. The creatures that populate this indoor playground embody the excesses and desires of 21st century Western civilization. Consumerism, selfishness, escapism, the lure of eroticism, vanity and decadence. All characters are metaphors for our society where loners swarm their digital dream world. They are symbolic reflections of egos and an imagination of people as they see themselves - unlike Bosch's version, where all individuals more or less look the same. From a horny Hello Kitty to a coke hunting penis snake. From an incarnate spybot to headless fried chickens. 

These characters, once precisely painted dream figures, are now digitally created 3D models. All of them have been given their own animation loop to wander through the landscape. By placing them altogether in this synthetic fresco, the picture is never the same. What the animation and Bosch&rsquo;s triptych have in common is that you&rsquo;ll hardly be able to take it all in, you can watch it for hours.

&lsquo;Paradise&rsquo; was commissioned by the MOTI Museum in The Netherlands for the exhibition New Delights, which is part of the Hieronymus Bosch 500-year anniversary. A gigantic video installation of this work was exhibited in the Museum until the 31st of December 2016.

TITLE :Branded Dreams - The Future Of Advertising

DESCRIPTION :"The real question is not: How many ads do we see? The real question is: What do we have to do to see no ads? And the answer is: go to sleep" (James B. Twitchell)

We see ads everyday and everywhere. They have become part of our life. While some people try to avoid seeing ads, advertisers keep finding new ways to reach us. However, they are unable to reach us when we sleep. Our dreams are the last safe and add-free place so it seems.

But what happens when advertisers have the possibility to enter our dreams? Based on recent developments in brain science and technology this might be possible in the near future. 

This animated short is an impression of a dream manipulated by a brand we all know.

DESCRIPTION :Music : Suns  https://www.facebook.com/sunsofficial and https://twitter.com/wearesuns
Another Sci Fi music video I animated :  https://vimeo.com/80788696

In the Summer of 2013 Suns approached me with the idea of developing a music video for their track 'Bells' and upon listening to the track -which I loved- I immediately had thoughts of an astronaut travelling alone through space. With this initial image in mind I began experimenting with various visual effects using After Effects. 

I used two AE plugins: Plexus 2.0 and Trapcode Form, I started to develop my ideas which involved generating the thin line aesthetic and dots that I was after. The majority of the 3D models used in the video are based on real objects from Space; the Hubble Space Telescope, Progress and Voyager 1. The planets and moons in the video are generated using NASA imagery, and helped to create a formal aspect to an otherwise abstract piece. Once I'd settled on the visual look for the piece, I began to think about how the structure will be developed in relation to the journey of the astronaut and the emotion of the track.

DESCRIPTION :- January 30, 2012 -

I would like to thank everyone that has taken the time to watch and appreciate my animation. It really is a great honor and incredibly motivating. I'm excited about creating new work and sharing it with you all!

--

My graduation project. I wanted to create something that would not only be fun to watch, but also tell a bit more about the process of animating. Sometimes your ideas and creations seem to have a mind of their own, and although this might actually be a good thing, you just get frustrated because it gets further and further away from your original plan...

I animated the whole thing in Toonboom first, then printed everything and cut out a large part. Then, using stop-motion technique, I re-created the animation again. This allowed for me to show a bit of the huge amount of work that goes into animating and it gave me a way to make the animator's presence a bit more tangible.

I hope you will enjoy this one!

DESCRIPTION :www.geist.xyz is a different kind of fashion project: what looks at first glance as an eccentric tangle of simulated dance and a color coordinated tumblr exploration turns out to be a study of handcrafted algorithmic textiles and procedural surfaces.

A synthetic ghost shifts simulated textiles from passive matter to live organisms. They behave like apparitions in an artificial choreography, with movements that are imaginary yet familiar. Like a constant metamorphosis, the same sequence gets transformed over and over again. At each step, all aspects of the designs are modified, from algorithmic pattern to color scheme to fabric behaviour. The results are meandering layers of style changes.
A linear montage shows the intricate details. Shuffled layers of metronomic sounds emphasize the transformation fluctuating in and out of sync.

The grid of moving images on www.geist.xyz visualizes our conceptual approach and color scheme.

DESCRIPTION :Plurabelle - Our Fires (edit by Mattis Dovier)
http://stellarkinematics.bandcamp.com/track/b3-our-fires

Drawings, animation and editing by Mattis Dovier

Music by Plurabelle &rsquo;Our Fires&rsquo; from Phantom Pyramid LP out on june 16th on Stellar Kinematics.

In addition to pixel art and frame by frame animation, graphics in this video are based on various influences. The main ones arise from the underground manga, especially Maruo Suehiro's "ero-guro" or erotic-grotesque style (to name one), that mixes both horror and erotic genres. Human passions such as love and violence become exacerbated to their climax, making the man look like a crazy and decadent animal, the whole thing taking the form of a macabre poetry.

Adolescence, embodied by the mutation into a monstrous beast, is a tribute to B-movies, drawing references from John Carpenter's or illustrator Charles Burns' universes. Symbolism in the transition into adulthood is seen as a rite of passage, requiring the death of a human being and the birth of another. The haunting mystical song immerses us inexorably into the intricacies of this transformation you can't avoid, whatever you do.

&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;

Outre le pixel art et l'animation image par image, l'univers graphique de la vid&eacute;o est bas&eacute; sur diverses influences. Les principales sont issues du manga underground, et plus particuli&egrave;rement du genre "ero-guro" ou &eacute;rotique-grotesque de Suehiro Maruo (pour n'en citer qu'un) qui m&ecirc;le horreur et &eacute;rotisme. Les passions humaines telles que l'amour et la violence se voient exacerb&eacute;es jusqu'&agrave; leur paroxysme, montrant l'homme comme un animal fou et d&eacute;cadent le tout sous la forme d'une po&eacute;sie macabre.

L'adolescence repr&eacute;sent&eacute;e par la mutation en un &ecirc;tre monstrueux rend ici hommage aux films de s&eacute;rie B, notamment en s'inspirant de r&eacute;f&eacute;rences issues de l'univers de John Carpenter ou de l'illustrateur Charles Burns. La symbolique du passage &agrave; l'&acirc;ge adulte est v&eacute;cue comme un rite initiatique, n&eacute;cessitant la mort d'un &ecirc;tre et la naissance d'un autre. La chanson, &agrave; la fois lancinante et mystique, nous plonge inexorablement dans les m&eacute;andres de cette transformation qui sera quoi que l'on fasse, in&eacute;vitable.

DESCRIPTION :Life and its moments form the basis of our project. The intention is to portray the experiences of Life - how it begins with hope, develops with time and ends with the unknown. For this project, life is personified and starts out with no specific form or color since it is but a seed.
Our existence is a daily adventure filled with unexpectancies, hope, happiness, warmth, emptiness, loneliness, and anticipation. As one goes through the passage of life at different stages and times and encounters various problems, one learns to grow and develop through these experiences.
However Life may turn out to be, it is in the sum of these experiences that Life draws on to truly flourish and blossom.

This one was a long time coming.  As a mid year school project, I never brought it to the point I wanted.  But the compositing and sound is finally finished and is ready for viewing!  Looking forward to advancing this premise into a game as far as my skills allow.  (that will be an even longer time coming :)  Enjoy!

EDIT: Thanks so much for all the love!  I wish I had remembered to share this concept art for the game version. http://i.imgur.com/P7h8miy.png As I've messaged a few people already, my next animation post will likely include links to an artwork blog and a bandcamp profile, so feel free to follow!

YEAR :01/01/1970
DESCRIPTION :Imagine living a life where the world you perceive and experience around you is entirely different than that of your peers, and your family &mdash; where you feel&hellip; misunderstood.

Autism is the one of the highest growing serious developmental disabilities today. Our wish with this piece is to give a glimpse into the lives of children living with Autism and, in any way we can, to inspire positive change through a deeper tolerance and understanding.

For our senior film, we have chosen to represent an extreme case: life through the eyes of a child who is non-verbal, and her constant struggle to cope with the world around her. We understand that Autism is complex, and has a wide spectrum; this film is meant only as an interpretation inspired by our research and time spent within the Autism community.

Thank you for watching!

TITLE :The illusion of life
AUTHOR :cento lodigiani
LICENSE :Attribution License
YEAR :01/01/1970
DESCRIPTION :The 12 basic principles of animation were developed by the 'old men' of Walt Disney Studios, amongst them Frank Thomas and Ollie Johnston, during the 1930s. Of course they weren't old men at the time, but young men who were at the forefront of exciting discoveries that were contributing to the development of a new art form. These principles came as a result of reflection about their practice and through Disney's desire to use animation to express character and personality.
This movie is my personal take on those principles, applied to simple shapes. Like a cube.

The story takes place in Lisbon at the time of the great maritime discoveries. Explorers, looking like pigs, arrive in the harbour after a long voyage across the oceans. Everywhere in the city small groups gather and congratulate each other. Couples meet again after a long separation and hug one another. They organize spontaneous round dances and celebrate their return. Meanwhile, a young pig has the strange feeling of being completely isolated from the others in his own native city...

DESCRIPTION :Hi !

I love playing drum and I love moving images so i decided to make this little experiment, triggering animation with my e-drum.
This is really fun to play audio and visual notes !
It's not the best drum solo ever but try to imagine that whith whiplash drummer :)

Hope you find it fun and interesting !

Thanks to Youenn Denis, Adrien Sibille and Arnaud Sourdeau for the filming.

TITLE :NOVAE - An aestethic vision of a supernova
AUTHOR :Thomas Vanz
LICENSE :Attribution License
YEAR :01/01/1970
DESCRIPTION :Headphones and 1080p recommended.

Novae is a movie about an astronomical event that occurs during the last evolutionary stages of a massive star's life, whose dramatic and catastrophic death is marked by one final titanic explosion called supernova.
By only using an aquarium, ink and water, this film is also an attempt to represent the giant with the small without any computed generated imagery.
As a tribute to Kubrick or Nolan's filmography, Novae is a cosmic poem that want to introduce the viewer to the nebulae's infinite beauty.
-
Novae est un film qui conte l&rsquo;histoire d&rsquo;une supernova, &agrave; savoir la mort d&rsquo;une &eacute;toile g&eacute;ante dans une explosion cataclysmique.
En s&rsquo;aidant uniquement d&rsquo;encres et d&rsquo;un aquarium, ce film se veut aussi une tentative de repr&eacute;sentation du monde infiniment grand avec des ph&eacute;nom&egrave;nes du quotidien, en s&rsquo;interdisant d&rsquo;utiliser des images de synth&egrave;se.
Comme un hommage aux films du genre de Kubrick ou de Nolan, Novae est une ode et une introduction &agrave; la beaut&eacute; infinie du monde des n&eacute;buleuses.

TITLE :1976
AUTHOR :Aggressive
LICENSE :Attribution-NoDerivs License
YEAR :01/01/1970
DESCRIPTION :1976 meditates on presentiment and sound. The surreal short crafts an unsettling atmosphere of foreshadowing and immanent change. A clever combination of live footage and CGI, the film allows its soundtrack to drive the visuals. Everyday objects reverberate, twist and react to an oncoming pulse of events as they converge on a farmhouse lost in rural America.

A film by Aggressive, The Loop & Echoic.

Between others...

This is a short we did just for fun between projects. We started designing the city, 7 months ago, and when it was done, we thought it would be nice if a monster tried to destroy it, failing in the process. "Let&rsquo;s add a goofy robot!" we said. The idea was to have a simple 10-second piece with the robot failing. Just for the kicks. The funny thing was that when we included the Mon-star there, it wasn&rsquo;t enough. So, between projects of course, we wrote a story and added more and more scenes... Then, when we were right in the middle of the project, the movie Pacific Rim came out; a terrible coincidence. Such bad luck! (The movie is really awesome). Anyways, we ended up with this 2-minute short. We never intended it to became a short in the first place, but it did. Please, enjoy!

TITLE :Art is Theft
AUTHOR :daniel cordero

YEAR :01/01/1970
DESCRIPTION :Art is Theft is a personal project I've been planning for a long time.

Creation is not inspired by one man, woman or one thing. We are influenced by our daily fair, diverse artists etc. I have admired various influential artists in my life, such as Picasso, Dali and Warhol. With this film, I attempted to convey an approach to the creative process and express how all artists, at any level, "steal" the art and the very soul of other artists, while forming their "original" pieces. 

The one and only Ambrose Yu did a wonderful work in the sound design of this piece. I strongly recommend listening to this film while wearing headphones. Thank you.

YHWH

I am the might before the sword
The tremors in the spear shaft
I craft my ways from blazes of firestorms
Absorb the failings of deadened ends
To render the floors I dance upon
I am the spaces between applause
The roars of hearts running through Heaven&rsquo;s halls

I breathe the forms of light and silence
Stall the course of cosmic riots
I am the glory of the giants Manaslu / Sagarmatha
Watchmen of the Asian plains
They yield my name
Made famous through the cries
Of albatross flocks enflamed in Pacific fires

I am dressed in the spray of Nevada dunes
Clothed in the shadows of Sahara caves
I am the light of lunar flames fleshing the rains of Amazonia
I paint the trains of Antarctic quests
Release dominion to desert Panthera

I authorise the remains of Aztec and Inca
That bloom through the visions of mountain tribes
I ride the skylines breathe the signs 
Ignite the paths of astronomy&rsquo;s eyes
I am the unheard heard in the storms that burn on my words
I am the yearned for
I am the Word

I emerge deciduous from the wetlands of your cries
Rise through the moments you wake
I bring the dawns that shake the fevers from your remembrance
I am here
I am imminent

I am he who crosses the plains through which you strayed
Discover the parts extinction seared
I dust away the dried remains of tears
I drain the lakes of your regrets
I wet the wells
till the soil
Placate the toil
quell the rages
Sew the broken pages
With my belief in you  

I bring the you you have never quite met
I am the desire that keeps your pillow wet
I am the heartbeat you seek when you chase after dreams
In the reachings and sighs you are looking for me

In the body touching body
It is me you seek
In the groans and the longings
It is me you seek
In the yearning dream
In the need-to-be-seen
In the love-me love-me
It is me you seek
In the breath-drop wonders
In the gasping hunger
In the touch of a stranger
That makes you feel younger
In the books and the fables
In the this-is-me labels
In the is-this-me?
Is   this   me?
In the hear-me hear-me
Say-my-name
In the touch-me need-me find-me need-me
In the aching pain
In the love
In the music
In the beats
And the taste
In the heat
In the need
And the need
For embrace
In the colour
In the gaze
In the meaning
The desire
In the flame
Of the voice
And the spirit
Of the fire

When you cry for more my name you weep
I am he who waits for you to reach
I reach for you and wait
When you lie half broken and awake
I am the watchman of your sleep
I wait and wait til the shakings cease

I am the Truth they call release
When the darkness flares and starts to speak
I sculpt the shades of daybreak
It is me you seek&#8203;

What do astronauts dream of? How do they feel while they float above the clouds? In 1991 Helen Sharman became the first Briton in space; in this animation, hand-drawn by Ri animator-in-residence Andrew Khosravani (http://andrewkhosravani.com/), Sharman shares a dream she often has about returning to space, and talks about what it&rsquo;s like to gaze down on the earth from above.

&lsquo;A Place Called Space&rsquo; is the 2015 Royal Institution advent calendar. Every day in the run up to Christmas we'll be releasing an original piece of content exploring the human experience and cultural significance of space travel. With hand-drawn animations, experiments in zero gravity, interviews with astronauts and creative data visualisations, the calendar will fire you into space every morning.

'A Place Called Space' channels the voices of seasoned astronauts and expert scientists through the eyes of a team of talented animators, film-makers and artists, bringing you a thought-provoking gem to kick-start each day.

TITLE :Spherikal
AUTHOR :Ion
LICENSE :Attribution-NonCommercial License
YEAR :01/01/1970
DESCRIPTION :This is a small animation i did as an exercise to experiment and explore all the graphical possibilities of representing the idea of the SPHERE, always thinking in searching Gestalt and form. Its all done in 3d, but i was more interested in the graphical interest, flatten the surfaces, and only two colors, why more.The most difficult was to achieve the transitions between the different type of representation of the sphere, the morphing and metamorphosing. 

For the description of the project, all these frames plus the frames from the scenes that weren't included, visit - http://www.behance.net/gallery/Spherikal/3565597

It was all done in Cinema 4d R13, all with the Mograph module. Compositing and post in After Effects

DESCRIPTION :Chicago has many truly great buildings. It sits firmly on the map of global architecture and is the birthplace of the skyscraper. Creating a short video about just five great buildings is doing this city a massive disservice, as there are many and this is simply my thoughts. I hope you enjoy it. I loved creating it.

"Voice is unnecessary to express ideas sometimes".

TITLE :The Story of Zero - Getting Something from Nothing
AUTHOR :The Royal Institution
LICENSE :Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs License
YEAR :01/01/1970
DESCRIPTION :What is zero? How did it come about? Hannah Fry tells the story of how zero went from nothing to something.

Once upon a time, zero wasn&rsquo;t really a number. Its journey to the fully fledged number we know and love today was a meandering one. Today, zero is both a placeholder, and tool, within our number system signifying an absence of a value, and as a number in its own right. 

But it wasn&rsquo;t always seen as that, and it still doesn&rsquo;t act quite like other numbers. Can you divide by zero, for example?  Hannah Fry explains how zero came about, from its origins in ancient civilisations, through the resistance it faced from the Roman numeral system, to being the cornerstone of calculus.

TITLE :Evolution of the Bicycle
AUTHOR :Visual Artwork
LICENSE :Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs License
YEAR :01/01/1970
DESCRIPTION :300 years compressed to a 1 min animation telling the interesting history of the bicycle, all the way from the wooden horse to the modern racer.

The video was made in combination with an application to the Royal Danish Academy of Fine Arts, 2013. 

Animation : Thallis Vestergaard
Music : Flying Home by The Benny Goodman Sextet

Note: Video updated September 2014


&ldquo;A bicycle is a two wheeled, human-powered vehicle, with one wheel behind the other.&ldquo;

The first track of the bicycle goes back to 1493 where Leonardo da Vinci made a sketch of a very advanced bicycle. This is not proven to be true though. So is there many uncertainties on when and who invented the
bicycles improvements along it's history.

00:05 &ndash; 00:12 
1790, A Frenchman named Comte Mede de Sivrac says to be the first to attach two wheels in each end of a piece of wood. This creation is referred as &ldquo;Velocifere&rdquo; or &ldquo;Celerifere&rdquo;

1817, The German Karl Drais von Sauerbronn built the first steerable bicycle, the &ldquo;Draisine&rdquo;. He&rsquo;s particular model is not shown in this animation though. 

00:23 &ndash; 00:25
1818, In England, Denis Johnson improved the draisine. He&rsquo;s model, &ldquo;Dandy Horse&rdquo; had bigger wheels and was lighter. 

00:30 &ndash; 00:32 
1839, Scottish, Kirkpatrick MacMillan is believed to be the inventor of the first pedal-driven bicycle, inspired by the locomotive. 

00:34 &ndash; 00:36
1866, Pierre Lallement&rsquo;s velocipede &ldquo;The Boneshaker&rdquo; is one of the first bicycles with pedals attach to the front wheel. He&rsquo;s fellow landsman Pierre Michau invented a similar model around the same time and it is unclear who really was the first to put pedals on a wheel, although it is quite certain it&rsquo;s from France. 

00:38-00:39
1869, The Frenchman Eugene Meyer has the credit for inventing the first high-wheeled bicycle, the famous &ldquo;Penny-Farthing&rdquo;. English, James Starley did a lot of further improvements on the high-wheelers and in 1870 he invited the &ldquo;Ariel&rdquo;.

00:43 &ndash; 00:44
1880-85, G. W. Pressey invented the &ldquo;American Star&rdquo; bicycle followed with the &ldquo;Pony Star Bicycle&rdquo; by William S. Kelley 

00:46 &ndash; 00:47
1879, Harry J. Lawson&rsquo;s bicyclette was one of the first chain driven bicycles. 

00:49 &ndash; 00:50
1891, W. Scantlebury

00:51 &ndash; 00:52
1885, J.K. Starley &ldquo;Rover Safety Bicycle&rdquo;
1890 C. D. Rice

TITLE :There is Always a Way
AUTHOR :Dennis Hoogstad

YEAR :01/01/1970
DESCRIPTION :A little fellow on a big adventure!

Sometimes you have a problem that seems impossible to solve. You think you've exhausted every possible way, and are ready to give up.  

'There is Always a Way' is a personal project where I experiment with a metaphorically driven storyline about a circle that looks for the "out of the box" solutions to get out of a tight spot. Whether its going with the flow, or asking for help... the little circle shows us all that giving up should never be an option. 

Curious on the meaning of each metaphor? Feel free to have a look on my website to see every scene explained.

TITLE :INNUENDO
AUTHOR :Tim de Haan
LICENSE :Attribution-NonCommercial License
YEAR :01/01/1970
DESCRIPTION :Innuendo (2014) is an animated graduation short about procreation and reproduction. Life itself is inherently obsessed with this ongoing cycle. With our film we want to show that the whole planet, and not just complex organisms, participates in this sensual dance of life.
Innuendo is created by five students at the Utrecht School of Arts in the Netherlands. Created over a span of five months of hard work and three months of conceptual preparation. Its a creative exercise in which we're sketching out a sense of sensuality and fertility without any human imagery using various visual metaphors.

Shiny Toys Festival
M&uuml;lheim an der ruhr
Germany 2013
vjsuave.com

A spiritual journey in search of self-knowledge, conscience and love. This short movie was produced independently and recorded during vjsuave's residency at "Shiny toys Festival" in Germany. 

Vjsuave is Ygor Marotta and Ceci Soloaga, a new media art duo based in Sao Paulo, as specialists in moving projection they create movies that are poignant, warm and personal, crafted from hand-drawn media, transformed into digital animation then projection-mapped in a way that seems to bring streets alive. Characters walk across the landscape with a convincing blend of movement and real moving projections.

Four site-specific interventions. Artefact festival, STUK Kunstencentrum. Leuven, BE. 2013

'Architecture is judged by eyes that see, by the head that turns, and the legs that walk. Architecture is not a synchronic phenomenon but a successive one, made up of pictures adding themselves one to the other, following each other in time and space, like music.'

DESCRIPTION :Infinity&rsquo; is an immersive environment project by Refik Anadol. Project is an integral part of artist&rsquo;s ongoing &lsquo;Temporary Immersive Environment Experiments&rsquo; which is a research on audio/visual installations by using the state called immersion which is the state of consciousness where an immersant&rsquo;s awareness of physical self is transformed by being surrounded in an engrossing environment; often artificial, creating a perception of presence in a non-physical world.

In this project &lsquo;infinity&rsquo; chosen as a concept,a radical effort to deconstruct the framework of this illusory space and transgress the normal boundaries of the viewing experience to set out to transform the conventional flat cinema projection screen into a three dimensional kinetic and architectonic space of visualisation by using contemporary algorithms.

Light is the major element in the experiment, used to blur and interconnect the boundaries between the two realms actual/fictional and physical/virtual. It signifies the threshold between the simulacrum space created by the projection technology, and the physical space where the viewer stands. The experiments will discuss the inherent spatial qualities of immersive virtual environments and their effect on the embodied person. Through the presented framework, the experiments intends to question the relativity of perception and how it informs the apprehension of our surroundings. Rather than approaching the medium as a means of escape into some disembodied techno-utopian fantasy, projects sees itself as a means of return, i.e. facilitating a temporary release from our habitual perceptions and culturally biased assumptions about being in the world, to enable us, however momentarily, to perceive ourselves and the world around us freshly.

Room size: 4M x 4M x 4M
Medium: Four channel Audio/Visual Installation running on custom software. (Original experience: 14 Minutes, 7 algorithms.)

Exhibitied at Artnivo&rsquo;s &rsquo;40 Meters 4 Walls 8 Cubes&rsquo; in collaboration with Istanbul Biennial at Zorlu Performing Art Center. November, 2015.

Thanks to: Sebnem Alp Akin, Alkan Eraltan, Kian Khiaban, Efsun Erkilic, Raman K. Mustafa, Zorlu Perfming Arts Center and Artnivo Teams.

DESCRIPTION :A Short Non-Commercial Movie by Pixelhunters http://www.pixelhunters.com

Life is a battle of choices and roads to be taken. We choose our own paths, we mark our own map. Once choices have been made, actions play out. Consequences are delivered. And in the end, we live with those consequences.
But, the real struggle is making the choice to change how we take the roads untaken.  Are we tough enough to decide for ourselves when the time comes?

Script:



Life.

Given to us billions of years ago. 

Breathing, making choices, cultivating purpose.

we marvel with the reasons  our core existence.



Predominance, obsession and what's only left is its lethal outcome around.



I was given life,

what have I done ?



Memories occurred to me like a flood, 

ravishing into the deepest turmoil of my thoughts. 

I used to see myself as an aggressive bullet wandering - 

tearing  down races,  razing enemies.

The recollection of my belligerence. Will it change?



Now  all my senses could perceive is emptiness. 

couldn't have I stopped at the right moment, 

when few hearts were still beating?

Is there still something worth opening my eyes for?

Yet, here I am, facing again that demon inside me.

another battle to win



The monster in me respires with prudence. My inner self astounded. 

and then, for a heart beat



I know what to do with it.

TITLE :Painted: An Adventure in Stop Motion Body Art
AUTHOR :Elvis Schmoulianoff
LICENSE :Attribution-NonCommercial License
YEAR :01/01/1970
DESCRIPTION :Painted is an experiment in stop motion face & body painting that plays with the idea of giving paint it's own life and personality on a living canvas. The whole project was initially inspired by MUTO - the incredible stop motion graffiti video by BLU.

Imagined, painted, modelled, photographed & edited by Elvis Schmoulianoff

Music: Flow Motion by Square One
https://soundcloud.com/squareonednb
https://www.facebook.com/pages/Square-One-Music/306025526108643?fref=ts

Everything was photographed in my bedroom in late 2012/early 2013 with a point and shoot camera , natural light, a pile of paints & body paints, brushes and a mirror over a period of 10 days. The final sequence contains footage from five of those days and is comprised of 1064 individual images, the rest was mainly retakes of the first minute which all taught me valuable lessons in what not to do...

Painted was inspired by some amazing artists and the video is a little homage to their outstanding talent and a thank you for the smiles and wonder it has given me. Jean-Michel Basquiat's fantastic body of work, Fritz Lang's impressionist masterpiece Metropolis and the sumptuous makeup art of Alex Box all served as fantastic visual inspiration, Blu's stop-motion graffiti inspired the concept itself and the sheer ingenuity and borderless creativity of LA based artist A Dandypunk and England's Happy Slap Boutique gave me the push to embark on a new creative adventure on my own.

SPOILER ALERT
2 years ago when I was 16, I had the idea of a story that visually portrayed the perspective of someone who has no vision, a blind girl. I found the ironic use of the visual medium (a short film) intriguing. So,  all through Last year, I decided to practice the craft of filmmaking and create it myself. Modeled, animated, and rendered entirely in Blender. minor post production in After Effects and edited in Premiere.

DESCRIPTION :In a beautifully collaborative relationship, we were able to work directly with the global insurance brand, MARSH. Keeping a company that large, in that many places around the globe, aligned, informed, and focused is a full-time job. Our project was to write and visualize a short film that would inspire and motivate as well as create a buzz inside the organization and out. With a unique take on a Saul Bass-inpsired aesthetic and a hero character going on an Odyssean journey, we took MARSH on a their own creative trip and back again.

DESCRIPTION :www.bliink.tv

For Ted-Ed 

https://ed.ted.com/lessons/how-small-are-we-in-the-scale-of-the-universe-alex-hofeldt

In 1995, scientists pointed the Hubble Telescope at an area of the sky near the Big Dipper. The location was apparently empty, and the whole endeavour was risky &ndash; what, if anything, was going to show up? But what came back was nothing short of spectacular: an image of over 1,500 galaxies glimmering in a tiny sliver of the universe. Alex Hofeldt helps us understand the scale of this image.

TITLE :30 motion tests in 30 seconds
AUTHOR :Steffen K
LICENSE :Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs License
YEAR :01/01/1970
DESCRIPTION :Over a period of 30 days I challenged myself to created 1 second of animation every day. The idea was to experiment and explore workflow in the software package Cinema 4D and publish one frame from my experiments daily..

The rules:
-Animate 1 second everyday
-Publish one frame daily at blog.steffenk.net
-Put it all together to approx. 30 seconds of animation

In the end I didnt quite manage to complete this challenge on a daily basis, but I ended up with 30 motion tests and this is the result..

TITLE :Handle With Care
AUTHOR :ticktockrobot
LICENSE :Attribution-NoDerivs License
YEAR :01/01/1970
DESCRIPTION :As a tongue in cheek rough guide to caring for a newborn baby, Handle With Care combines factual information with the imagination and personal experiences of director and first-time father, Jun Iwakawa. The resulting visual interpretation plays out in the form of a humorous, often warped, infographic.

Split across nine categories: Bonding, Sleeping, Feeding, Poo/Wee, Bathing, Clothing, Playing, Transporting, and First Aid, this is a whistle stop tour of practical data and tips which leaves the viewer to decide what is fact and what is most certainly not.

TITLE :Void Season
AUTHOR :ZEITGUISED
LICENSE :Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike License
YEAR :01/01/1970
DESCRIPTION :&ldquo;Void Season&rdquo; is a simulated fashion project.

Part dreamlike theatre, part lateral cargo cult hustle, a quick succession of bold garment designs acts as an ersatz runway show. In a minimal set of solid backdrops, radiant colors and oblique choreography second the exquisite design of costumes that have been entirely artificially generated.

A wealth of custom procedural surface detail emphasizes the uncanny rift between the realistic presence of the guises and the abstract vacancy of the digitized human movements.


ZEITGUISED X OY:

INFORMA&Ccedil;&Otilde;ES SOBRE O CURSO 3D - BUTTERFLY



THE CONCEPT OF BUTTERFLY HOUSE
When I was just a kid, I&acute;ve been painting some butterfly in a nice way, the method consist in draw just in one side of the paper then close the both sides to have a mirrored image. The most common image was a butterfly. 

This thing keep in my mind until these days. I ever think about create some new architecture using this mirror idea to create a new image. A lot of  kind of solutions passed through my mind but I never did, until now.

I was really really tired to see the same kind of 3D architectural images: Box house on middle of trees or just lofts with same furniture. So I mixed this two problems and thought in a solution., using the butterfly main idea. It was just think "outside the box".

95% of the models was made by myself and the other 5% are premade models.

TITLE :Lullaby Theories: Same Same But Different
AUTHOR :Coat of Arms
LICENSE :Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs License
YEAR :01/01/1970
DESCRIPTION :Inspired to explore science from the perspective of toddlers, we discuss epigenetics with our three-year-old identical, twin daughters in this episode from "Lullaby Theories."  Simple and yet elegant, the science behind gene modification comes easily to these identical twins who notice daily how Same Same but Different they are from each other.

"Certain circumstances in life can cause genes to be silenced or expressed over time. In other words, they can be turned off (becoming dormant) or turned on (becoming active) ... What you eat, where you live, who you interact with, when you sleep, how you exercise, even aging &ndash; all of these can eventually cause chemical modifications around the genes that will turn those genes on or off over time."

YEAR :01/01/1970
DESCRIPTION :&ldquo;TRANSFORMING&rdquo; is 3D Printed Nail stopmotion animation.

Created by Planner/Director Mizuki Kawano and Producer Yuna Takayama from Taiyokikaku Co., Ltd.
The company's computer graphics artists produced the animation data based on the designs created by the Manicurist, Hatsuki Furutani.
Then the data was printed into three-dimensional artificial nails by full color 3D printer, &ldquo;ProJet 660 Pro&rdquo;.
Total of 521 nails were produced, and the thinnest part of the nails were only 0.56mm.
We attached and replaced the nails to the actual human hand, and filmed frame by frame. 
This stop motion animation was created without using any computer graphics.

DESCRIPTION :This is another one of our group project work, called "Ruuuun!!". We hope more people will be able to get together, play and enjoy the creation.
We have held 3 animation-painting live events, but which are inconvenient for friends in other cities. So I have the idea about play it through the internet, and this short film is the result.
Involving more than 100 people, I'm more excited for having so many creative friends gathered than just the number. The style is various and uneven, but the enthusiasm is absolutely the same. What we have is enthusiasm, which I believe is perfectly reflected in this project!
Though there is still a lot more we can do in this work, but we did have fun, this is great and enough!

TITLE :G-STAR The Art of RAW
AUTHOR :GLASSWORKS VFX
LICENSE :Attribution-ShareAlike License
YEAR :01/01/1970
DESCRIPTION :Glassworks Amsterdam is very proud to have collaborated with the G-Star in-house creative team to realize the Art of RAW campaign film. Till now the global campaigns of the brand were based  on iconic print advertisements, shot by one of the biggest names in photography Anton Corbijn, featuring talents like Liv Tyler, Magnus Carlsen and Gemma Arterton.

We were therefore extremely excited when G-Star approached Glassworks to realize their first ever campaign commercial which will run online and in cinemas across the globe. Since the brand took a break from conventional advertising in their market, this was a great opportunity for the two brand&rsquo;s expertise to meet: denim and high-end digital animation and visual effects.

The result was a dramatic, fully CGI, macro-level journey through the denim-making process. G-Star's creative team created the concept for the video and collaborated with our in-house CGI director Rudiger Kaltenhauser, who created the magical and moody world for the film, provided that it remained faithful to the core processes involved in creating their world-famous RAW denim. We were completely sold when we knew the challenge was to create a film with a photo-real running skeleton dog and that it would have the soundtrack by US super-producer Skrillex.

Rudiger storyboarded the action treatments, designed the style frames, edited the cut, and then led our team of lighting/texturing TD's and animators in bringing everything to life. There were many challenges, not least of all creating CGI denim that reflects the fabric the brand is so passionate about. The team also took on the challenge to create a texturing/lighting setup that allowed the beauty of each step of the denim making process to be clearly understood but also live up to the expectations of the G-Star denim specialists.

Cut from the 60" film, a 15" teaser was screened to launch their show at the Bread & Butter fair in Berlin last month, and whilst the full-length film will be playing on their website, you can see the 30" in cinemas and throughout their stores globally. The CGI skeleton dog is the leading visual throughout the Art of RAW print campaign and you might even be able to race him yourself in the Hong Kong subway!

TITLE :The Risks of The Everyday - with Jared Diamond
AUTHOR :The Royal Institution
LICENSE :Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs License
YEAR :01/01/1970
DESCRIPTION :Jared Diamond shares what he learnt about risk and everyday life from the tribes of Papua New Guinea. This was taken from a 2013 conversation, &lsquo;The world until yesterday&rsquo;. Watch the full discussion here: https://youtu.be/ceLuaf7low4

Pullitzer Prize-winner Jared Diamond discusses how insights from the lifestyles of far-removed cultures can impact the way we think about our own lives. Is it worth worrying about the risk of everyday actions like falling in the shower or tripping on the street? Each time you do these things, the risk of mishap is low, but we do them every single day. Over time, does that mean these tiny risks accumulate to become almost inevitable?

This animation was produced by Andrew Khosravani, thanks to generous support from the Sfumato Foundation.

TITLE :Coffee Time
AUTHOR :wan-tzu
LICENSE :Attribution-NonCommercial License
YEAR :01/01/1970
DESCRIPTION :Every cup of coffee contains its own soul, extracted from your feeling today.every cup of coffee is like a magic show containing different journey and bringing the unending imagination and surprises.With a sip of coffee, you not only taste your own story, but also change your perspective of the world.

------

it's my first time try to make a stop-motion animation. 

I used to be a senior student majoring in commercial design who had no interest whatsoever in animation. However, last summer I saw a amazing work "SNASK" (http://vimeo.com/10435821) , which awakened in me a huge interest in Stop-Motion. This was also my very first encounter towards videos.

Indeed, "Coffee Time" was adapted from Mike Crozier's   animation "SNASK", I used that as a template for my own first practice video made with stop-motion. I tried to recreate the effects from "SNASK" (http://vimeo.com/10435821) , and I learned so much from this process. At the end of the video, I mixed in an animation containing my personal favorite coffee elements.

It's not apply to any commercial act. It only served as my first practice of stop-motion, and I show great appreciation and respect for Mike Crozier. The original producer was notified prior to the publishing of the video. My initial intention was to humbly share my practicing result with relatives and friends. But now the consequence was totally out of my expectation. I am greatly honored by all the feedback and encouragement, which I am deeply appreciative of.

I hope that everyone can put more emphasis on the processing&#157;. For me, a heart-touching film is like a good mentor, exerting much influence. And "SNASK" is just like a mother to me, bearing the interests for stop-motion, and inspiring me with the motive of learning. All the praises and admiration the video has received undoubtedly belongs to Mike Crozier.

It took me one month for deliberation, production, prop preparation, almost two weeks of shooting, and 1,705 pieces of photos to finish the video.

TITLE :BEAUTY OF THE LOOP /// Animation
AUTHOR :Felix von Líska
LICENSE :Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs License
YEAR :01/01/1970
DESCRIPTION :BEAUTY OF THE LOOP is a 2D animated isometric music video that solely consists of loops. The animation tries to fathom the possibilities and restrictions of exclusively working with loops. The combination of these loops and the song takes the viewer on an expedition through a surreal geometric world &ndash; over and over again. This is my graduation project at Berliner Technische Kunsthochschule (btk).

TITLE :Sye Elaine Spence - 1964 (Official Music Video)
AUTHOR :dreambear
LICENSE :Attribution-NonCommercial License
YEAR :01/01/1970
DESCRIPTION :dreambear's music video for Sye Elaine Spence's "1964", is a candid, yet delicate, peek at the innocence, tenderness, and simplicity children naturally exude. The video exemplifies the unique craft of combining artistic techniques and materials from childhood to get the concept across. Each frame of the film is hand drawn with crayons or painted with watercolors and then photographed on an animation stand, using homemade rotoscoping to project home movies onto countless sheets of paper.

AUTHOR :Sander van Dijk

YEAR :01/01/1970
DESCRIPTION :Personal Project The vision of Pausefest Melbourne.
Download in 4K : www.sandervandijk.tv/blog/2014/5/9/4k-and-60fps-animation
Color Tutorial AE : www.vimeo.com/sander/color

Brightling - Music Composition / Production and Sound Design
Jaclyn Blumas - Voiceover
Sander van Dijk - Concept / Motion Design

Inspired by the perspectives of: Remco Janssen, Martijn Hogenkamp, Kevin Megens, Menno Fokma, Koen Oosterbroek, Wesley Wittkamper, Anatol Kushp&egrave;ta

Reach out, Share and Demonstrate each other to grow and get better at what we love to do.
I loved working on this project and want to share some of its insights on how I approached to color the elements. Go to www.vimeo.com/sander/color to download the tutorial. Leave a comment there if you find it helpful and if you see more possibilities for improvement from your unique perspective!

Artists need to visit Pause Fest: Connect to others, to gain knowledge in order to grow. Every artist has a unique story to tell about his or her style and perspective, by allowing individual stories to be shared, Creatives grow individually and together as everybody learns from one another. This animation visualizes exactly that concept in a very abstract way.

99% of this animation is vector and continues rasterized. Every element in the scene is the same size and but put to gather in different ratios. Expression where used to keep the colors dynamic by creating a texture library. ( See tutorial )

Desktop Magazine: "Your thoughts on why motion designers are so willing to work for love and participate in festivals like this?"
Because motion designers believe in their work. They do it for the love of it. Pause Fest is a free platform to experiment with, try new things and for people to become better at what they do. Working for love is the only real satisfying element in this work and it gives you the energy to go on and make the next piece your best piece ever. Artists need a space where they can take the time to communicate to each other and get back to that core issue of why we are doing this. What are we spending your valuable time on? What are we communicating? The festival is a moment to pause! and share what you've learned with other unique designers out there in order to grow, get inspired and learn a whole lot yourself.

AUTHOR :Ariel Victor

YEAR :01/01/1970
DESCRIPTION :An invite to hop on a bus and skip town is broadcasted to a number of youngsters living in an abandoned city. The teens, however, are hugely occupied by their love of technology and Internet habits and have been living deep in solitary with their own gadgets. With only a little time, the teens had to struggle against their ever-growing tech-addiction in responding to the call before the departure.

AUTHOR :Reza Dolatabadi

YEAR :01/01/1970
DESCRIPTION :What if you watch a film and whenever you pause it, you face a painting? This idea inspired Reza Dolatabadi to make Khoda. Over 6000 paintings were painstakingly produced during two years to create a five minutes film that would meet high personal standards. Khoda is a psychological thriller; a student project which was seen as a &lsquo;mission impossible&rsquo; by many people but eventually proved possible...Enjoy!

TITLE :Manhunt - Short Film
AUTHOR :Northern Lights Films
LICENSE :Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs License
YEAR :01/01/1970
DESCRIPTION :'Manhunt' is a dark, surrealistic revenge fantasy of animals on humans for the mess they have made. 
The core idea for this short film is to switch the roles of humans and animals, hunters hunted, to show how the world could be like from the animals' perspectives, and to put us humans in their shoes.

We would like to extend our gratitude to PETA for allowing us to use some of their footages.

Based on Exodus 12:
21 Then Moses called for all the elders of Israel, and said unto them, Draw out and take you a lamb according to your families, and kill the passover.
22 And ye shall take a bunch of hyssop, and dip it in the blood that is in the bason, and strike the lintel and the two side posts with the blood that is in the bason; and none of you shall go out at the door of his house until the morning.
23 For the Lord will pass through to smite the Egyptians; and when he seeth the blood upon the lintel, and on the two side posts, the Lord will pass over the door, and will not suffer the destroyer to come in unto your houses to smite you.
24 And ye shall observe this thing for an ordinance to thee and to thy sons for ever.
25 And it shall come to pass, when ye be come to the land which the Lord will give you, according as he hath promised, that ye shall keep this service.
26 And it shall come to pass, when your children shall say unto you, What mean ye by this service?
27 That ye shall say, It is the sacrifice of the Lord's passover, who passed over the houses of the children of Israel in Egypt, when he smote the Egyptians, and delivered our houses. And the people bowed the head and worshipped.
28 And the children of Israel went away, and did as the Lord had commanded Moses and Aaron, so did they.
29 And it came to pass, that at midnight the Lord smote all the firstborn in the land of Egypt, from the firstborn of Pharaoh that sat on his throne unto the firstborn of the captive that was in the dungeon; and all the firstborn of cattle.
30 And Pharaoh rose up in the night, he, and all his servants, and all the Egyptians; and there was a great cry in Egypt; for there was not a house where there was not one dead.

LYRICS by David King, aka Duke of Uke:

DEATH: Falling stars you wished upon
are cinders now and now they're gone
their residue festoons my fetid field.
Unfeeling husks of lovers past
the shells are all that ever last
I've taken everything that they concealed.
Whoever told you life was fair?
Look around you, everywhere
the cruelty of nature is displayed!
Why the scorn?
Why the surprise?
Everything that's born must die
and it isn't I who made the world that way.

What wicked little twist of fate
placed you here upon my plate
Here, where no one hears your cries?
Where was your god to steer you through
Perhaps your god's forsaken you
Otherwise why lead you here to die?

BA (spirit of the dead): I, I know the way how
I'll melt away now
I know the way.
I'm feeling bliss now
Dissolved to mist how
strangely I go
away
Now I finally know

DEATH: It's merely moments now,
moments now until
your feeble flesh bends to my will
and it will
so rest your weary head.
There'll be no pain,
no pain at all
as everything you are dissolves
Your fate resolved
upon my silky thread.

BA: I, I know the way how
I'll melt away now
I know the way.
I'm feeling bliss now
Dissolved to mist how
strangely I go
away
Now I finally know
(repeat)

DESCRIPTION :We were invited by our friends of PH3 estudio, to create an opening welcome sequence for the second edition of the congress 4GN in Bogot&aacute;, Colombia. The only brief we got was to represent each speaker with an abstract jewel, and each one of the should have their very one piece. We created a cool fast paced edit were each 3D jewel has a unique character, material and treatment that reflects the work or personality of a speaker. We also were invited to speak about the work we do at the studio, and we had a great time!

Fuimos invitados por nuestros amigos de PH3 Estudio, para crear una pieza de bienvenida para la segunda edici&oacute;n del Congreso 4GN en Bogot&aacute;, Colombia. La &uacute;nica direcci&oacute;n creativa que recibimos, fu&eacute; que deb&iacute;amos representar a cada conferencista con una joya diferente. Creamos esta secuencia donde cada una de las joyas 3D tiene un material y tratamiento &uacute;nico, que representa el trabajo o la personalidad de los conferencistas. Fuimos tambi&eacute;n invitados a dar una pl&aacute;tica acerca del trabajo que hacemos en el estudio y nos la pasamos incre&iacute;ble!

TITLE :Nightingales in December
AUTHOR :Theodore Ushev
LICENSE :Attribution-NoDerivs License
YEAR :01/01/1970
DESCRIPTION :Awards:

    Diploma of Merit, Tampere Film Festival 2012
    RPT Onda Curta Award, Monstra Lisbon 2012
    Canadian Film Institute Award for Best Canadian Animation, Ottawa International Animation Festival 2012
    Special Mention, Expotoons 2012
    Special Jury Mention, Cinanima Espihno 2012

This metaphorical surrealist tale is an allusion. Nightingales in December is a trip into the memories, and the fields of the current realities. What if the Nightingales were working, instead of singing and going south? Is the innocence the only savior of birds songs? There are no Nightingales in December... What is left, is only the history of our beginning, and our end.

TITLE :Animal Planet Rebrand
AUTHOR :DBLG

YEAR :01/01/1970
DESCRIPTION :Discovery Channel invited DBLG to refresh it's channel Animal Planet. 

Coinciding with the launch of the HD simulcast for Animal Planet, the refresh of the on-air look is intended to give the brand a more confident and distinctive tone of voice, resonating with its audience, and linking the brand with it's content.

To do this we developed four unique worlds in which the inhabitants could interacting with their surroundings. Once the four environments were designed, we worked closely with Blue Zoo who modelled and animated the creatures.

For the look and feel we were inspired by hand made art such as origami and paper craft. This warm and captivating style certainly appeals to the target audience.

TITLE :The Heart of Sky
AUTHOR :MIRARI
LICENSE :Attribution-NonCommercial License
YEAR :01/01/1970
DESCRIPTION :Released on 9th of NOV / 2016

Project Name: The heart of sky | Original Short Film
Production company: Mirari & Co. (Mirari.tv)
Music: Zelig Sound









In the past two years, we've been working on this short film as a chronic back ground project. We have come across hundreds of 

problems and limitations during the production process and used to think we might never be able to publish it. By pushing our creativity and with the curiosity to see how far we can go, we made our way here.
Taking inspiration from Mayan myth, we have initiated this story about how lives might have been created on earth, in a science 

fiction style. Most of the references, which helped our design are from a book called Popol Vuh. The book is a corpus of historical 

narrative about post Classic K'iche' kingdom, which is also considered as Mayan bible.

See full credit list in the end of the film.

Oniric beasts and tentacles run through the city leaving no trace of what's left behind, melting things in an undistinguished pink blob. Conceived as a music video for Copycat Club's "Ganz Berlin", this animation pushed the lyrics to the limit, giving shape to a disturbing and gloomy scenario.

TITLE :Noclip
AUTHOR :Eva Figueroa López
LICENSE :Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs License
YEAR :01/01/1970
DESCRIPTION :"Noclip" is a fake trailer, for a movie that, for now, is not going to be made, about the incredible power of its characters to defy the physics of the world they live in, almost as if they were cheating a videogame. With this project, I wanted to both experiment with the concept and improve my animation skills. Hope you all enjoy watching as much as I enjoyed working on it!

The project was done entirely in Flash, and edited in Premiere.

TITLE :Every Shirt Matters
AUTHOR :studioflox

YEAR :01/01/1970
DESCRIPTION :Short has to cross the ocean. He is a bit scared...
A charming tale with a very real twist to raise awareness for the refugee crisis in the Mediterranean Sea.

As creatives, we feel the urge to use our skills for good, to give people in need a voice that can't be ignored. The stories we tell have the power to pierce through our protective shields so viewers can't help but look closely. And those who can't turn their eyes away are those who take action.

Thousands of people die in the Mediterranean Sea each and every year, but our attention has long moved on. Where governments fail to address these problems, NGOs step into the breach and save people from drowning. NGOs like Jugend Rettet, a group of young people, who run their own ship, the Iuventa, or Humany Tee, the t-shirt label, that gives 80% of its profits to Jugend Rettet. These people save lives and they need our help.

TITLE :Sougwen Chung, Cardia (Étude Op. 2), 2012
AUTHOR :sougwen
LICENSE :Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs License
YEAR :01/01/1970
DESCRIPTION :" In Cardia (&Eacute;tude Op 2),&nbsp;layers of digital representation coalesce with analog abstraction, forming the interior and exterior of a myogenic muscular organ. Cardia starts off with a tremor of movement without resolution, beginning a myopic journey through a cavernous and alien space. As disorienting and mesmerizing as it is wholly enveloping, the viewers gaze recedes slowly, at which point the form is revealed in its entirety. The transgression from interior to exterior coincides with a backdrop of crystalline shards -- a magnification of the form imploding, itself transforming into a cloud of iridescent particles and then fading to black."

Music: "Outside" by Sepalcure
Label: Hotflush

TITLE :RED
AUTHOR :RED
LICENSE :Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike License
YEAR :01/01/1970
DESCRIPTION :&uml;Based on a true fairy tale&uml;

As the silhouette of a lonely girl runs through the woods, something in the shadows is lurking her.

RED is an animated short film, which presents a new version of the classic tale &uml;Little Red Riding Hood&uml; by Charles Perrault. The directors Jorge Jaramillo and Carlo Guillot explore more thoroughly the drama, horror and realism of the story. A journey of feelings and moments, with visual and musical elements existing only to carry a clear and strong narrative.
In RED the directors based on traditional shadows animation, giving it a new perspective by using technology to create a new concept, while maintaining the visual and narrative force of the classic technique.

The production of the film was done almost entirely by the two directors and musician/composer Manuel Borda, who completed the story by reinforcing all emotions through it.

TITLE :How to Design a Particle Accelerator
AUTHOR :The Royal Institution
LICENSE :Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs License
YEAR :01/01/1970
DESCRIPTION :How do you go about designing a particle accelerator? Suzie Sheehy discusses how they  work, what form they take, and what champagne means to an accelerator physicist.
Watch more films in our series on particle accelerators: https://youtu.be/LR_aNOcnH0Q?list=PLbnrZHfNEDZx0mVe9wGxg5kyKdofRJJ7m
Please answer our survey about this film, and you could win &pound;100: https://www.surveymonkey.co.uk/r/D9GTKM7

The Large Hadron Collider at CERN has captured the imagination of the public. But particle accelerators take many shapes, and there are tens of thousands of other accelerators in use every day around the world.
Dr Suzie Sheehy designs particle accelerators. In this animation she leads us through the world of accelerators. They all share the same basic ingredients of an accelerator: particles, energy, control, collision and detection, and typically fall into three categories: linear, cyclotron and synchrotron.

The applications of accelerators range from individual medical care to answering the biggest questions we have about the universe. Each accelerator is the culmination of hundreds of people&rsquo;s efforts, though the designs themselves often start with a single person&rsquo;s idea.

TITLE :ANTS in my scanner > a five years time-lapse!
AUTHOR :françois vautier
LICENSE :Attribution License
YEAR :01/01/1970
DESCRIPTION :"I installed an ant colony inside my scanner five years ago. I scanned the nest each week..."

>This short film is an exploration of the aesthetic of life and degradation.&nbsp;

Five years ago, I installed an ant colony inside my old scanner that allowed me to scan in high definition this ever evolving microcosm (animal, vegetable and mineral). The resulting clip is a close-up examination of how these tiny beings live in this unique ant farm. I observed how decay and corrosion slowly but surely invaded the internal organs of the scanner. Nature gradually takes hold of this completely synthetic environment.
The ants are still alive : the process will continue&hellip;

TITLE :THE GAP by Ira Glass
AUTHOR :Daniel Sax
LICENSE :Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike License
YEAR :01/01/1970
DESCRIPTION :I think it was in the time of spring 2012, when I came across David Shiyang Liu's lovely piece of work about Ira Glass. It was the most inspiring and motivating video I had ever seen in my life. I watched it over and over again, listened to Ira Glass' voice, and told myself, that I am not the only person who is constantly disappointed about the gap between one's taste and one's skills. Later in 2012, I decided to do my own filmed version of Ira's interview - using my own language to tell his message. It took me about a year from concept to upload.

I made it for myself and for anybody who is in doubt about his/her creative career. I also think that Ira Glass' message isn't only limited to the creative industry. It can be applied to everyone who starts out in a new environment and is willing to improve.

THANK YOU
Ira Glass, whom I've never met in real life, but who had such a big influence on my development. Thank you for telling beginners what nobody else does.

David Shiyang Liu for the video that inspired me to start the project. You all should watch his awesome kineticTypo-version here: http://vimeo.com/24715531

Steven Sasseville for painting the "taste" painting for me.
Pedro Sousa for his advice and working his ass off at the "creative work" chalkboard.
Wolfgang Kraus for letting me borrow his sound equipment.
Kai L&ouml;hnert for working out on his birthday in the "fight" take.
Wolfgang Hendrik Schnabel for giving me the museum-like atmosphere and his silhouette in the painting takes.
Hermiyas &Ouml;tzt&uuml;rk for his hairy "good enough" hand.
Orange Hive Studio for light equipment and location.
Mima and Heinz Sax-Schmitz for the location of the "ambitions" take and finding me the "finish 1 story" typewriter.

A SPECIAL THANK YOU
Solveig Gold for being the most patient and supporting person in my life. She appears in a lot of scenes in this video.
Jutta and Uwe Sax for several pieces of equipment and their support.

DESCRIPTION :Sticky Frames presents:
"LUCKY" by Kirsten Carina Gei&szlig;er and Ines Christine Gei&szlig;er
11:00 min, 2D, 2015

"LUCKY" is looking for happiness. This animated short is questioning our search as well as its aim: What does luck mean for the individual? Is failure the only possibility?

"The film focusses on the pursuit of happiness. Failure and desire play a part, and the sweet smell of childhood lingers in the air, but it has lost some of its romance. The idea that this film is maybe not about horses at all suggests itself quickly. These precious friends are simply well-suited for being protagonists as their image is not yet as worn as Mickey Mouse and Bugs Bunny and they are still complex in terms of content.The horses trot and gallop across the screen and even drink at the bar. These horses are not happy, maybe for one exception. Loss follows great success, love is only answered by a painful lack of understanding, Black Beauty turns into Broken Beauty. This film does not play in Wendy-mode and neither serves the romance of horse loving teenagers."*

TITLE :Resonance: The Interpreter's House
AUTHOR :Jr.canest
LICENSE :Attribution-NonCommercial License
YEAR :01/01/1970
DESCRIPTION :Resonance is the vision of SR Partners; a collaborative project with over 30 independent visual and audio designers / studios. The aim was to explore the relationship between geometry and audio in unique ways. 

Animators and Audio Designers were paired up at the beginning of the project and were given the guidelines to create a piece between 12 and 20, I had the awesome opportunity to work with David Kamp.

This piece is my approach to the connection between audio and shapes, I tried to give this abstract animation a certain type of emotion, that every movement happening on screen would be more than the sole propose of look cool and sync to the sound, to do this I based this video on a section of John Bunyan's "The Pilgrim's Progress", when Christian is guided trough the Interpreters House. It's a very personal, graphic and non-descriptive explanation of this part of one of my favorite books It's intended more to help me as the animator to give some meaning to the animation rather than narrate the story.
(If you're curious about this you can find an extract of the book here: http://goo.gl/aJ91j)

DESCRIPTION :A Semiconductor work by Ruth Jarman and Joe Gerhardt.

Made for the exhibition Invisible Fields at Arts Santa Monica in Barcelona Spain.

20 Hz observes a geo-magnetic storm occurring in the Earth's upper atmosphere. Working with data collected from the CARISMA radio array and interpreted as audio, we hear tweeting and rumbles caused by incoming solar wind, captured at the frequency of 20 Hertz. Generated directly by the sound, tangible and sculptural forms emerge suggestive of scientific visualisations. As different frequencies interact both visually and aurally, complex patterns emerge to create interference phenomena that probe the limits of our perception.

20Hz is co-commissioned by Arts Santa Monica + Lighthouse . Supported by the British Council.

DESCRIPTION :Animated Artworks for TOOL Live Performances
October 2015, San Francisco, CA

I have worked on new visuals based on my current experiments with morphogenesis and higher dimensional geometries for one of my all-time favourite bands TOOL. Consisting of 10 video loops, the visuals took place for the first time in Tempe, Arizona concert, the only show of 2015 and later were involved in the 2016 U.S. tour accompanying the new song "Descending".

TOOL is an American rock band from Los Angeles, California, formed in 1990, has won three Grammy Awards, performed worldwide tours, and produced albums topping the charts in several countries.

So many thanks goes to Breckinridge Haggerty, Ann Chien, Adam Jones & Tool for making this happen and so many years of inspiration that has driven my creative practice!

Liquid Skies is the story of an astronaut hurtling across the universe--past suns you and I may never glimpse, yet fighting battles we may all face ourselves one day.

This is my student short film at Art Center College of Design. It is my first big attempt at animating or doing something at this scale and finish. This is part of a broader story that I am working on, following an astronaut across the suns of many galaxies. I hope to share it with the world in the next year.

TITLE :Magnitude Rituals 지진영제(地震禜祭)
AUTHOR :DONGHYUN LEE
LICENSE :Attribution-NonCommercial License
YEAR :01/01/1970
DESCRIPTION :The earthquake of M5.8, the largest on the Korean Peninsula, occurred in Korea, which was called the "Earthquake Safety Zone," in 2016. Gyeongju City suffered a great deal of damage due to the ineffectiveness of the Korean government and the insecurity of safety. By the year 2017, there have been about 500 aftershocks, and Koreans are living in fear of an earthquake that will happen anytime soon.

Magnitude Rituals is an image of praying that no earthquake will happen in Korea. The former Korean peninsula country, which was a farming country, had a ritual to pray for rain in the sky every drought season. In this regard, this work expresses a ritual to wish an earthquake not to happen. The image consists of two frames. The image on the left represents the progress of the ritual, and the image on the right represents the earthquake where its value of the graph representing the earthquake converges to zero and the process of the earthquake is reversed.

What I wanted to pursue in my work was the communication of messages using the contrast of Korean traditional and shamanic images and sophisticated mathematical graphics. On the surface, it appears to be unrelated images, but as the ritual process progresses, it expresses that the figure indicating the earthquake in the graph subsides, and the audience will be able to gradually understand and appreciate the images.

TITLE :Pincel de Zorro (English)
AUTHOR :Hug Codinach
LICENSE :Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs License
YEAR :01/01/1970
DESCRIPTION :Personal project to promote the book Pincel de Zorro, now in its second edition, published by Ediciones Ondina. An illustrated tale from the Spanish author Sergio A. Sierra, Pincel de Zorro is a whimsical story set in Japan, full of tenderness, magic and sadness. The story is complemented by unique illustrations, all of which are hand drawn by Meritxell Ribas using a complex technique called grattage, in which paint is scraped off the canvas with a pointed tool.

Pincel de Zorro tells the tale of Shiori, a little girl whose life changes the same night her father brings home a dead fox from a hunting trip. Mysteriously when her parents decide to sell the precious skin of the animal, they receive a visit from a magical woman. 


This project has been an amazing collaboration between my friends, Sergio and Meritxell, authors of the book, Albert Alay, the music composer, and me, taking the role of creative director. This has been a passion project of ours, done with no budget, and we hope that someday we can bring these wonderful characters to life in a feature film.

For more information visit pinceldezorro.es

Direction, Design and Animation: Hug Codinach
Illustrations: Meritxell Ribas
Text: Sergio Sierra
Music: Albert Alay

All illustrations were camera projected in C4D and composited in After Effects. The ink was generated with Turbulence 2D from Jawset. I used a Canon 5D MrkII to shoot the brush footage.

Special thanks to Rick Gledhill at King & Country and Gabriela Effron.

DESCRIPTION :Colored using Ray Dynamic Color aescripts.com/ray-dynamic-color

When visiting the BUCK New York back in 2011, Orion Tait casually told me that they where changing the logo. That scared me a bit because I really loved the way it looked, but when he showed me the new designs I thought it was even better. The diversity of geometric shapes within each letter sent my mind racing&mdash;giving me the biggest animation playground possible, which is partially why I took it upon myself to animate this new piece. I hope you enjoy it.

DESCRIPTION :Five friends
Five musicians
One garage
WE WILL NOT BE QUIET.

G A R A G E
Adrian and his four friends don't quite fit in anyplace, 
but THE GARAGE, where the frustrations of school, 
bullies and your usual teen angst can be drowned 
out with guitars, drums and vocals. 



S E R I E S   S Y N O P S I S

Ever since Adrian has been able to walk, talk, and hold an electric guitar, 
his one and only ambition in life is to be in a world- renowned rock band. 
No feeling could possibly come close to that of being in front of 
thousands of adoring fans, chanting your name, hanging on to your every 
word, buying your t-shirts and albums like ravenous scavengers. 

But first, he has to make it through high school.

TITLE :Pause 2016 Motion Response - A Brief History of Time by CraveFX
AUTHOR :Pause Fest
LICENSE :Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs License
YEAR :01/01/1970
DESCRIPTION :In this conceptual animated short, we aim to create a comedic performance where the past, present and future realities overlap and interact in an environment where time has no start or end. 

A modern take on Zbigniew Rybczy&#324;ski's Tango, every actor that participates in this space is trapped in an infinite loop where their actions simultaneously bare and yet bare no consequence to another. Starting with a single actor that performs the same series of mundane actions, followed by another and yet another, we start to discover the motivation of these characters and their performance do not simply coexist but are correlated in a complex chain of events. Hilarity ensues as every absurd action cumulates in an amalgamation of intricately choreographed antics.

We all have a dream. We can call it understanding of truth or connection with god or accord to the Great order- it doesn't really matter. And we all are trying to match it in some way.
Sometimes there are powerfull advisers coming to guide us.
Here comes a really BIG question: will you follow the authority or follow your heart?
Yes, this movie is full of picture and sound symbols, yes, it's about loneliness in modern society, yes it is about keeping nature clear and returning to Great harmony, yes it's about technocracy and global addiction to technologies, and about religion...
Tell me, what do you see here, how do you understand this animation.

TITLE :Only Human
AUTHOR :Zwelly Co.
LICENSE :Attribution License
YEAR :01/01/1970
DESCRIPTION :What if aliens had already visited us and made their decision that they don't have any use for us or our planet? 

While we believe we&rsquo;re a very smart species, if you go to any public place, you'll see so many faces buried in their electronics missing the world around them. 

These were central ideas to the development of this short film titled &ldquo;Only Human&rdquo;, when it was written in 2009. Soon after that, it was abandoned like many personal projects but never forgotten. After 6 years it was picked back up to explore the idea further and after 7 years, we&rsquo;re so happy to finally show this project.

Please support it at tallenge:

This is a leveled message with a social context.

1st level- simple non-associative identification, used to release needed signification of two technics- men's beginning as a thick form withth white ornamental and woman's beginning as a thin firm of lines with black thin forms.

2nd level- associative identification supporting images of previous level. Giving certain thoughts to make recipient understand certain ideas about social state of men and women.

3rd level- associative+ factological level. Gives a links to some religious contecsts (as esotherical christian and buddist parables, daoist texts and some of kabbalah schemes) for people who can disconnect the sense from what do they see.

Thank you for checking out please write comments and add to fav's. If you have questions- feel free to ask

TITLE :Beyond Tellerrand
AUTHOR :Device
LICENSE :Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs License
YEAR :01/01/1970
DESCRIPTION :Opening Titles for Beyond Tellerrand held in D&uuml;sseldorf, Germany in May 2015. A meeting place for design, technology and inspiration.

Beyond Tellerrand invited us to create the opening for it&rsquo;s fifth edition. We proposed a visual journey through a personal and na&iuml;ve interpretation of interactive work, representing the most thorough, methodical and organized part of the process through repetition, and the creative side through clever abstract compositions and a colorful palette, aiming to exalt both sides of the process.

The speakers appear amongst a tridimensional variety of a bold, geometric graphic imaginary, creating audiovisual loops with a mechanical behaviour, showing repetition in an appealing and fun way to reflect creativity.

Music & sound design: Aimar Molero

Every second our planet is spinning you, but you can begin to spin our world yourself. Every day you are able to go ahead in order to be happy and make happy others. Yes, it is not so simple. There are many obstacles in the way. Life is not a movie. Although it as a movie has a physical end. Nobody knows what will be in the end of our life. And while you live you are the director of each moment.
 Our new Stop Motion Animation "I LOOK & MOVE" about all those people who were able to turn this world, to change something, build something, create something and do something that tracks on our planet.
 
The process of creating this stop-motion animation is described in the blog of our site:

DESCRIPTION :"We're From the Same Madhouse" is a video of all the portraits I painted of my friends(mostly).This exactly a set of the GIFs I made. I love to hand-paint portraits then make them into GIFs(short animation),sometimes I will dub them,make them more fun.I name this series "We're From the Same Madhouse" because all my friends are the same as me,we're always behaving like madmans in the real world,very funny and interesting! We don't think as normal people nor live like normal people.I think everybody need his own personality, to be differentiated from other people.To live a more interesting and unique life!

TITLE :BLOOMS 2: Strobe Animated Sculptures Invented by John Edmark
AUTHOR :John Edmark
LICENSE :Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs License
YEAR :01/01/1970
DESCRIPTION :Blooms are 3D printed sculptures designed to animate when spun under a strobe light. Unlike a 3D zoetrope, which animates a sequence of small changes to objects, a bloom animates as a single self-contained sculpture. The bloom&rsquo;s animation effect is achieved by progressive rotations of the golden ratio, phi (&#981;), the same ratio that nature employs to generate the spiral patterns we see in pinecones and sunflowers. The rotational speed and strobe rate of the bloom are synchronized so that one flash occurs every time the bloom turns 137.5&ordm; (the angular version of phi).* Each bloom&rsquo;s particular form and behavior is determined by a unique parametric seed I call a phi-nome (/f&#299; n&#333;m/). -John Edmark

John Edmark is an artist, designer, and inventor. He teaches at Stanford University.

*For this video, rather than using a strobe, the camera was set to a very short shutter speed in order to freeze individual frames of the spinning sculpture.

TITLE :Strange Rain
AUTHOR :B K
LICENSE :Attribution-ShareAlike License
YEAR :01/01/1970
DESCRIPTION :In the dog-days of the Australian summer, when day after day of relentless heat evaporates everything volatile, including one's will to move, to eat...we wait for the thunder cracks that open up the sky, releasing the Strange Rain.

When the distant thunder cracks split the air, the deluge begins, as the Strange Rain falls, so falls our anxiety.

The Strange Rain is accompanied by the sweet smell of negative ions charging up the atmosphere, the negative ions flood our senses, giving us a sense of relief, of peace, of release.

This short work is about that experience.
Live through an Australian summer and you will understand.

'Strange Rain' is an excerpt from '26 Suicides'.

26 Suicides is a 27 chapter, non-narrative new media art work. 

**26 Suicides was initially designed to use surround sound and multi channel video to deliver an enveloping, synesthetic experience.  26 Suicides is currently being remixed as a virtual reality art experience.**

It is the personal and intimate testimony of my synesthetic life. The 26 Suicides installation uses 10 audio (surround) sound channels and 8 video channels to deliver an enveloping, synesthetic experience. The videos here on Vimeo are excerpts. They are single channel video with stereo audio, offering a taste of the installation.

Watch them if you are not afraid of dangerous modern art.

The compression on Vimeo has squished most of the goodness out of this work, if you are interested, ask me about getting the high-res version.

DESCRIPTION :Acrylics, ink and markers on paper create the animated world that is, "We're Alot Like Trees". The track was inspired by the writings of author and preservationist, John Muir. It&rsquo;s meaning was born out of a hope for togetherness with all walks of life and unification with the great outdoors. Here's Kabu's interpretation.

TITLE :LuYang Delusional Mandala by LuYang
AUTHOR :LuYang
LICENSE :Attribution-ShareAlike License
YEAR :01/01/1970
DESCRIPTION :Music Edit by Cavia666 (www.djcavia.com)
The artist created a digital nonsexual human simulator in her own shape for the first time to complete an artwork. Because of the powerful curse in the content of the work, the artist has to apply the spell to herself to avoid harming others.
This artwork is all about neurosciences, in which the artist is always interested. She makes use of the principle of the stereotactic system, the deep brain stimulation and RTMS working on the deep limbic system, in order to extend delusions, substitute into religious perspective and fugacious meditation on the material world and produce objective  delusions.
This work is the artist&rsquo;s reflection on her creation in the past, at present and in the future. Is consciousness adhere to the brain? Where on earth is consciousness? The artist simulates the delusions of damaging herself and her works over and over again in her work. It can be sure that these delusions will eventually come true.
This artwork is the second piece of the artist&rsquo;s new series of works. The first one is Moving God. The new series of works are still involved with categories such as religion and neuroscience, etc. They are different from the works in the past, using this method to meditate and practice, and constructing delicately through different ways this delusional mandala.

TITLE :A Dandelion Going To Seed - Carl Sagan on Space Travel
AUTHOR :The Royal Institution
LICENSE :Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs License
YEAR :01/01/1970
DESCRIPTION :In 1977 Carl Sagan gave the CHRISTMAS LECTURES on space travel. In his final lecture, he spoke about the human race venturing out into space; his words are as relevant now as they were then. 
Day 14 of our advent calendar, A Place Called Space. http://rigb.org/advent

Watch his lectures in full on the Ri Channel: http://richannel.org/christmas-lectures/1977/1977-carl-sagan

In 1977 we had begun to tiptoe into space, and felt on the edge of the Universe, about to dive in. Almost 40 years later, we&rsquo;ve made great progress and large strides further into space, but in some ways have barely got our feet wet. The words Carl Sagan concluded his Lectures on &lsquo;The planets&rsquo; with are as meaningful now as there were then. 

As we look to send people to Mars and then beyond, are we finally realising Sagan&rsquo;s vision? 

This clip from the 1977 CHRISTMAS LECTURES was animated by the Ri animator-in-residence Andrew Khosravani. http://andrewkhosravani.com/

&lsquo;A Place Called Space&rsquo; is the 2015 Royal Institution advent calendar. Every day in the run up to Christmas we'll be releasing an original piece of content exploring the human experience and cultural significance of space travel. With hand-drawn animations, experiments in zero gravity, interviews with astronauts and creative data visualisations, the calendar will fire you into space every morning.

'A Place Called Space' channels the voices of seasoned astronauts and expert scientists through the eyes of a team of talented animators, film-makers and artists, bringing you a thought-provoking gem to kick-start each day.
Check it out at http://rigb.org/advent

TITLE :YALDABOATH ” 作 牙 “
AUTHOR :hiorganic
LICENSE :Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs License
YEAR :01/01/1970
DESCRIPTION :As the night falls and the stars among us was summoned
Stars morphed to all kinds of wishes, and were fallen to the bottom of our co-collective sub-consciousness.
Where indwelled incredible abundance that was always one step away from us, they shines not only artificial but also superficial luminous glamour. 
primitive desires kept manifesting, calling us, more is good and more is legit.
The cloaked Yaldaboath looked upon this society of materialism which It dominated for millenia.
the slow and struggling process for evolution of human's consciousness reflects in It's eyes, while it took our Lush as It's supper, yet the most delicious ones are those ambiguous faiths as always.
All these happened in a small temple of Land-God, which sits in a place of nowhere.
Now, may ashes to ashes, dust to dust.

TITLE :Nature projections in São Miguel Island
AUTHOR :vjsuave
LICENSE :Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs License
YEAR :01/01/1970
DESCRIPTION :The world is like a canvas for Sa&#771;o Paulo-based artist duo Ceci Soloaga and Ygor Marotta, aka &ldquo;VJ Suave&rdquo;. 
This is the result of their art residency at Walk&Talk in S&atilde;o Miguel Island, Azores were they gave life to magical beings.
Taking advantage of the beauty of local nature, the duo projected their animations in different spots of the island as the Lagoa das Empadadas, Porto da Ribeirinha, Cachoeira do Cabrito and Lagoa Verde in Sete Cidades.
Using long exposure photographs, they created short videos of stop motion, which achieved a fantastic result combining traditional animation, projection and nature. For each video, they took around 5 hours, to be able to record the different textures and reflections the landscape creates exposed to projection. Each picture was exposed for 15 seconds, for example the video of the moon was assembled with 284 photos. No post-production was made.

Remind me Abstract Painter Kenneth Noland's Painting "Beginning". This kind of direct me to Color field Painting era. The colors of the logo were prominent enough to execute it in a minimal way. For me the question was, how I can get out of that circular borders of the logo without losing the colours and the main shape of it.
The main inspiration came from the Painter which I always admired Morris Louis and his Color Field Paintings. I've decided to combine these two ideas in my design (colours & stripes) and execute it with Strands as simple as possible and give the birth of Colr concept, expand the idea with a smooth motion that is integrated to the Logo and Typeface and observe the sheer beauty and impact of color.

DESCRIPTION :Pandemonio is a kaleidoscope of monsters, animals and other strange creatures brought to life by the primitive and franzied pace of Zu's music. Each figure is made by overlapping felt circles. The animation is obtained by moving, resizing and painting every circle without deforming its perfect shape. Have fun!

Pandemonio &egrave; un caleidoscopio di mostri, animali e altre strane creature che prendono vita al ritmo frenetico e primitivo della musica degli Zu. Ogni figura &egrave; costruita sovrapponendo cerchi di feltro. L'animazione &egrave; ottenuta spostando,dimensionando e colorando i singoli cerchi senza mai deformarli. Buon divertimento!

DESCRIPTION :A small love letter to Design and Animation.

This year I started as an independent Designer and Animator, so I decided to create something which was dedicated to the job I truly love doing. In addition to this, I combined it with a personal touch to tell something about myself a bit as well. 

Hope you 'love' it!

Interview with Stephen Feinberg (Seiden ECD):

What was the strategic approach to this ad?

The strategic approach for the campaign overall was to highlight particular &ldquo;amazing things&rdquo; happening in medical innovation at NYP and its associated medical schools.
We saw a need for content to explain some of the advances being talked about in mainstream media in terms an educated lay person could understand, and in a way that would encourage engagement (as opposed to a &ldquo;talking lab coat&rdquo; video or overly technical material intended largely for professionals).

Why use animation?

The subject matter is difficult to visualize in a literal way. We wanted to tell a story, not dispense facts. We needed to use analogies and metaphors to get people to understand highly technical, abstract concepts&hellip;so animation was a natural choice. The key was to find a style that was entertaining but not cartoonish&mdash;witty as opposed to slapstick. Noma Bar was an excellent fit for that.

How does this fit into the Amazing Things campaign?

The patient stories will continue: their job is reinforce NewYork-Presbyterian&rsquo;s incredible, patient-focused care and the life-changing outcomes that result.This new effort, which is by design more informational and more specific to a particular clinical area, is meant to highlight specific areas of strength within the organization. It is also more &ldquo;retail&rdquo; in nature, allowing patients to find and make appointments with the appropriate physicians. Key to that is a significant digital component to the campaign.

Will you continue with patient stories?

See above. Our goal is to have a new set of stories out sometime in 2Q.

TITLE :The Arctic Light
AUTHOR :TSO Photography
LICENSE :Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs License
YEAR :01/01/1970
DESCRIPTION :Follow me on https://facebook.com/TSOphotography for more photos, videos & updates.

This was filmed between 29th April and 10th May 2011 in the Arctic, on
the archipelago Lofoten in Norway.

My favorite natural phenomenon is one I do not even know the name of, even after talking to meteorologists and astrophysicists I am none the wiser.What I am talking about I have decided to call The Arctic Light and it is a natural phenomenon occurring 2-4 weeks before you can see the Midnight Sun.

The Sunset and Sunrise are connected in one magnificent show of color and light lasting from 8 to 12 hours. The sun is barely going below the horizon before coming up again. This is the most colorful light that I know, and the main reason I have been going up there for the last 4 years, at the exact
same time of year, to photograph. Based on previous experience, I knew this was going to be a very
difficult trip. Having lost a couple of cameras and some other equipment up there before, it was crucial to bring an extra set of everything. I also
made sure I had plenty of time in case something went wrong.
If you can imagine roping down mountain cliffs, or jumping around on slippery rocks covered in seaweed with 2 tripods, a rail, a controller,
camera, lenses, filters and rigging for 4-5 hour long sequences at a time, and then
having to calculate the rise and fall of the tides in order to capture the essence - it all proved bit of a challenge.

And almost as if planned, the trip would turn out to become very
difficult indeed. I had numerous setbacks including: airline lost my
luggage, struggling to swim ashore after falling into the Arctic sea: twice, breaking lenses, filters, tripod, computer, losing the whole dolly rig and controller into the sea, and even falling off a rather tall rock and ending
up in the hospital. As much as I wanted to give up, the best way Out is
always &ldquo;Through&rdquo;. I am glad I stuck it through though because there were some amazing sunrises waiting. At 1:06 you see a single scene from day to night to day which is from 9pm to 7am. Think about that for a minute.. 10 hours with light like that.

I asked the very talented Marika Takeuchi to specifically compose and
perform a song for this movie, and what she came up with is absolutely remarkable. Thank you very much Marika!

DESCRIPTION :The human race has never experienced or known a state of purity.
It has never been free from rules, imperfections, restrictions or moral statements.

Always contaminated by societies&rsquo; pettiness, corrupted by the use and abuse of power of human beings over each other and nature itself.

The miseries, obsessions and degenerations of the self are reflected in capital sins and the moral dogmatism with which religions severely regulate and control human life. Corrosive and destructive tools born from civilization itself.
Thus mankind has abandoned its primary and original connection with own self. The only way to finding purity in our lives. This is the story of humanity.

AUTHOR :ZEITGUISED

YEAR :01/01/1970
DESCRIPTION :Synthetic constructions of shapes and structures that have a similar level of complexity as natural occurrences, yet follow rules that are manmade and artificial, and modelled by and according to human thought processes. Some are engineered from physical growth and distribution processes but altered towards a common design goal. The outcome was open in the beginning, so we would not produce something that we would know beforehand, to leave space to explore unknown territory. In the end the topic that crystallised from the results was the juxtaposition of simulated organic topologies and hard mechanic artefacts as they are known from technology production techniques. We produced synthetic spaces in which we invented rules and parameters that let those two formal worlds collide and interact and inform each other.

AUTHOR :Stephen McNally
LICENSE :Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs License
YEAR :01/01/1970
DESCRIPTION :Forgot is a short film about memory, emigration, longing, Jesus kitsch, cocktail sausages and children&rsquo;s television.
Forgot explores the shape of memory, telling the story of a life through its effacing. A non-linear narrative that flashes between childhood and maturity, as it all slips away. From what we long to remember, to what we'd sooner forget.

TITLE :Inside Me ( Nils Frahm - Me Rework)
AUTHOR :Dmitry Zakharov
LICENSE :Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs License
YEAR :01/01/1970
DESCRIPTION :This project is based on a 3D-scan technique, which allows me to reproduce an image of my own body as a 3D object in a software. It is possible to view this object not just from outside, but also from the inside as a negative as well, which creates abstract shapes. 
The colouration was generated with the help of colour data I took from a real picture. 

The film reflects the invisible inner world of an individual, which owns a small universe in itself, created by experiences and feelings - as well in the digital world as in real life.  We try to express ourselves and approach our world another being, but still, nobody can see in our souls entirely.

For me, the process of scanning is a very important part of this work itself. 
The idea of digitising a body and hence the creation and deformation of its computer generated self, reflects the digital world we live in today. We create an alternative world, in which everybody can be what they want to be. In some way, it resembles to an act of creation.
We never stop building more worlds for ourselves, even though there are already various ones encircling us, that we don't even understand yet. 
Each universe encloses another, which creates a new one, and the world next to us still seems far away. And so we look into infinity again, which inevitably surrounds us.

Olaf The Red is the nickname I've given him since he's getting so big.  He reminds me of a little viking.

DESCRIPTION :A young cyclist Sam tries hard to make peace with his younger brother Alex who suffers from an unknown illness.

This is my last film at CalArts!
Growing up with an older sister with pretty severe OCD, I faced difficulties when it came to hanging out with friends, and focusing on my dreams. My whole family was influenced by her illness and it was something that was very hard to discuss about. I always had mixed feelings about my sister because I understood that she was also struggling with her problems, but at the same time I just felt so unfair how everything had to revolve around her.

It's a story I always wanted to tell. I had a good experience making it!

DESCRIPTION :Here's the latest project I've been working on. 

The show was designed and controlled directly from the Cinema 4D timeline using a custom python plugin I created to interface with the lights. 

More on the process here:
https://vimeo.com/140330930/

Here's the official copy:

Adam Heslop (www.pixelsinprogress.com) at Jason Bruges Studio (www.jasonbruges.com) developed Feather Light to explore the power behind the combination of Cinema 4D and moving-head lights. Creating beautiful featherlike and mesh patterns to a soundscape by Nat Self. The piece was envisioned for a live event and this video shows the testing in the studio.

TITLE :SOILCONSWEB - Understanding the complexity of land
AUTHOR :uhsless
LICENSE :Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs License
YEAR :01/01/1970
DESCRIPTION :The Soilconsweb is a project, developed by a group of specialists from the University in Naples (Italy). It aims to create a tool that helps different stakeholders of land, making better, more sustainable decisions on their most important resource - the soil.
We were asked by the leader of the project - Prof. Fabio Terribile - to create an explainer, that shows why it is so important, yet so difficult to develop such a specific tool. Our main sources of inspiration were layers of soil profiles, found in the University's inventory, as well as quaint aerial photography of fields and land.
To make the dynamic complexities of presented topic more tangible, we went for a reduced visual approach, that gives a piece straightforward information.

TITLE :Internet Age Media 2016 Opening Titles
AUTHOR :Device
LICENSE :Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs License
YEAR :01/01/1970
DESCRIPTION :We created Internet Age Media (IAM) second edition opening titles. From Complexity to Emergence was the festival&rsquo;s key concept and the brief asked for a random, WTF but empathic video.

Our aim was to let the internet speak itself, to create a story reflecting internet reality, feeding from internet sources both in terms of concept and tools.
We used what internet had to offer us: on one side a 2015 top 20 hashtag list serving as key concepts to shape a highly random script, narrated by multiple artificial voices; and on the other we invited people to build 3D models through the online 123D App.

We designed an evolved hand with two main fingers (due to internet navigation) as the festival&rsquo;s mascot, representing the user and a guide through the opening titles.

TITLE :Vellum
AUTHOR :Vishal Shah
LICENSE :Attribution License
YEAR :01/01/1970
DESCRIPTION :Vellum is a moving sound sculpture. Projected 2D double images are aesthetically 3D extruded and in constant rotation. The plateau of each extrusion is either hidden or limited, holding and composing the pictorial plane. Movements are fast and slow turning into sculptural islands to the sound of an improvised double bass. Vellum is beautiful in detail and timely in each movement. Vellum becomes a mesmerising work to see and hear.

DESCRIPTION :Stanley's life runs like clockwork, until a chance encounter with a mysterious girl turns his world upside down...

About the film:
Stanley Pickle is a short pixilation film shot entirely on a stills camera on 2 sets and 2 locations at the NFTS. The film premi&egrave;red on to the festival circuit in June 2010 at the Edinburgh International Film Festival, where it picked up the McLaren Award for New British Animation, followed by Oscar qualification at the US premi&egrave;re LA Shorts where the film won Best Experimental. After a whirlwind journey through 2011/12 greeting diverse festival audiences worldwide, humbled by winning many more awards, screening on Virgin Atlantic Flights, broadcast in France, Spain and the US, being part of BAFTA Brits to Watch and distributed on iTunes, it's great to be able to say the film is finally available to view online.

DESCRIPTION :Becoming a Saint: Miracles from the afterlife. Over 2,000 years, the Catholic Church has canonized 10,000 saints. But how do you get the halo in your head? 
This video was produced for CNN on the day Mother Teresa was declared a saint by Pope Francis at the Vatican on September 4th 2016. Was a tight turnaround for this project, only had a couple of weeks to do all the design and animation for this, but happy with how it turned out and was a great project to work on.

AUTHOR :Combo
LICENSE :Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs License
YEAR :01/01/1970
DESCRIPTION :68 voces
Basado en el Cuento &ldquo;La Muerte&rdquo; de Hermenegildo L&oacute;pez Castro
Lengua: Mixteco de la costa, Oaxaca

English Version:

Long ago, there were three brothers who were extremely worried about what or who was that person or thing that killed people. Why do people die? They did not understand.
One day, a woman told them to follow the road and they would find an old man that could tell them where to find death.
They walked for a long time and finally they saw the old man, who, cleverly, told them: &ldquo;Very far away, where a very tall tree that writes its own story stands, is where you will find death. It lives there&rdquo;.
The three boys were happy, they were willing to put an end to that thing, so people would not die.
When they arrived, they were awed to see a leafy tree.
&ldquo;We will see who it is, right now,&rdquo; one of them said.
When they entered the trunk, they could only find gold, precious metals and silver coins.
Being sure that nobody or nothing existed there, they decided to divide the treasure into three equal parts.
But first, they decided that the youngest brother would go and find something to eat.
The youngest brother bought three drinks, a clean one and two poisoned. He was disgruntled because he thought that the treasure should be only form him.
However, the oldest one had a plan too.
When the youngest brother came back, both brothers killed him, not aware of his plan and finished the drinks.
The three brothers died.
The old man said well: &ldquo;Very far away, where a very tall tree that writes its own story stands, is where you will find death.&rdquo;

TITLE :HORIZON
AUTHOR :Gianluca Scuderi
LICENSE :Attribution-NonCommercial License
YEAR :01/01/1970
DESCRIPTION :Horizon as a limit to a known world, a point of no return where knowledge ends and an unknown world begins.
The horizion with time abandons that mysterious aura of &ldquo;place&rdquo; beyond which provokes death. Now this carries positive meaning that thanks to knowledge makes that border (between the sky and earth), a vision towards a new future. 
Thanks to the horizon that continuously embraces us, we have purpose, a creative place to constantly exceed. As an everlasting challenge, the horizon line is always ready to remind us about our limits, pushing us in every endeavour, joining possibilities. Everything depends on the point of view, and how we look at this immense line. The horizion as a point of arrival, Horizion as a starting point.


Horizon is a reconsideration of the concept of the horizion through an array of 1500 panoramic photographs, a video thought of as a infinite trace that encloses Sicily in a photographic itinerary at full speed, allowing the eye of the public to perceive a unique, infinite horizion.
In Horizon two concepts of horizions are established: in the real horizon we see the tangible and limited view, which is overlapped by the imaginary one, a source of innovation and discovery, overcoming limits.
Horizon is sponsored by Mosaicoon and it is played at Farm Cultural Park in Favara since 29th Jun to 30th Dec. 2015

Orizzonte come limite al mondo conosciuto, punto di non ritorno in cui termina il sapere ed inizia un territorio sconosciuto.
L&rsquo;orizzonte con i secoli abbandona quell&rsquo;aura misteriosa di &ldquo;luogo&rdquo; oltre il quale scorgersi provocava la morte, ora questo si carica di accezioni positive che, grazie al sapere, rendono quel confine ( tra cielo e terra), una visione propizia verso un futuro in arrivo. Grazie al &ldquo;circolo massimo&rdquo; che ininterrottamente ci abbraccia, noi abbiamo un traguardo, un luogo immaginifico da superare costantemente. Come una sfida imperitura, la linea d&rsquo;orizzonte &egrave; sempre pronta a ricordarci i nostri limiti, a spingerci in ogni impresa come un aggregatore di possibilit&agrave;. Tutto dipende dal punto di vista, nel modo con cui noi ci poniamo di fronte a questa immensa linea. Orizzonte come punto d&rsquo;arrivo, orizzonte come punto da cui partire.


Horizon &egrave; una rivisitazione del concetto di orizzonte attraverso una carrellata fotografica di 1500 immagini panoramiche, un video pensato come un tracciato infinito che avvolge la Sicilia in un percorso fotografico a tutta velocit&agrave;, lasciando percepire all&rsquo;occhio dello spettatore un unico, infinito orizzonte.
In Horizon si fondono due concetti di orizzonte: a quello reale che mostra una visione tangibile e limitata della realt&agrave;, si sovrappone un orizzonte fantastico, fonte di innovazione, di scoperta e di superamento dei limiti.
Horizon &egrave; patrocinato da Mosaicoon e sar&agrave; presentato al Farm Cultural Park di Favara dal 29 Giugno al 30 Dicembre 2015.

TITLE :Traces
AUTHOR :Emily Sheskin
LICENSE :Attribution-NoDerivs License
YEAR :01/01/1970
DESCRIPTION :Is our DNA the government's business?

The very things that we discard everyday and never think twice about-hair, skin, and saliva-can be clues about who we are. They can also as well as liabilities.

Traces focuses on the work of artist Heather Dewey-Hagborg, who created Stranger Visions, a series of masks based on DNA samples extracted from trash discarded in public places, and Invisible, a spray that erases and obfuscates DNA. Through her art, she raises questions around DNA privacy that parallel the very questions we are asking about who has access to our personal data.

These questions are not theoretical. Recently Black Lives Matter activist Deray was arrested during a protest and his DNA was sent to the FBI. Should this be acceptable? What regulations do we have around DNA collection?

YEAR :01/01/1970
DESCRIPTION :Dmitry Zakharov:
http://www.dmitryzakharov.de/
https://www.facebook.com/dmitryzakharov.art

Concept -
The work "impact" shows what kind of effects different living conditions can have to humans. In an abstract language the video visualizes how each person is able to stand up and form himself again and again by experiences and setbacks. Everyone undergoes both positive and negative phases throughout his life and its experience shapes our character.
Also negative setbacks can attract positive energy, thereby further to give new impetus to our environment. As soon as the work is related to the current situation of our society and global looks, you can also discover completely different aspects in it. Capitalism, which is like a machine influences the thought of many people and yet often achieves more suffering than happiness in our inner being. Even the dependence on black gold and other commodities, which inevitably gives power to the political elites controlling the development of our society.

Design -

The structure of the machine developed by the individual tracks from Max. 
For each sound track I built a part of the machine that can move exactly to the respective track. The result is a complex construct and interaction with the sound. The idea was also to visually break up the viewing habits and we decided to take an old steam engine as a reference. This created a nice mix between modern technology and forgotten artifacts. The project includes techniques of 3D animation, fluid simulation and post effects.

Max Cooper:

https://www.facebook.com/maxcoopermax

This track is called Impacts, and it's about the Impacts of life, which hammer away at each one of us like a machine, but hopefully in the end make us stronger rather than breaking us. So despite the mechanical pounding, lacking any softness or melody, hopefully there is still a positive to be found in this track, if you've heard it in a club you might know what I mean.
This track is part of the album named "Human", where I have taken lots of concepts common to all of us, and I have attempted to represent each on in the form of a piece of music. So I haven't decided to become a gabba producer just yet, this just happens to be the most abrasive concept on the album, and the most abrasive track as a result.
Linking the track and video to the concept was a straightforward process this time, just a matter of finding some nice mechanical sounds, then repeat repeat repeat, and layer in glitch and detail to hopefully hold the listener despite the sparseness. One interesting addition was the use of real guitar amps and speakers at Andy Ramsay's Press Play studio in London -- we ran the separate drum tracks through and massively overdrove them, then recorded back the results, which are basically heavily distorted hits, which you can hear at some points in my mix, but are brought to full effect in Perc's remix. The analogue distortion sounds pretty nice (in a nasty sort of way) I think.
For the video I was lucky enough to tempt in Dmitry Zakharov (who you may remember from my Micron video). Dmitry has created his beautiful retro impacts man-machine that hammers someone into creation, destroys them, and then brings them back -- a great visual abstraction of the original concept. Thanks Dmitry for your hard work!
So there you have it, I hope it's something interesting, even if it's not a serene experience!
Max

TITLE :Manture
AUTHOR :Radugadesign

YEAR :01/01/1970
DESCRIPTION :The work &laquo;Manture&raquo; was presented at the festival Imapp in Bucharest in September 2015. Professional dancers, curated by the choreographer Julia Chekmas, were engaged while processing the project. The facade of the city parliament was used for the projection show. The building is the second largest one in the world, after the Pentagon base. 104 projectors were used to extrapolate all the international artworks. The festival attracted more than 100,000 people.
 
In this work, the images of the four elements, their struggle and cooperation have been translated into the language of the body of man and woman in order to pass the specific detail emotion of natural elements through the passion of human movements.

TITLE :Moses Goes Down
AUTHOR :Nina Paley
LICENSE :Attribution-ShareAlike License
YEAR :01/01/1970
DESCRIPTION :Here is Exodus 3-7, too much to quote here. Featuring the Burning Bush, Moses, Hebrew slaves, strange gods (actually goddesses), Aharon, Pharaoh, a staff turning into a snake, and sing-along phonetic hieroglyphs. 
The introduction to this scene is "God Calls Moses to Mt. Horeb", here: https://vimeo.com/118255690

Music: Go Down Moses http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Go_Down_Moses
Arranged and performed by Louis Armstrong (with Sy Oliver's Orchestra, 1958): http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Louis_Armstrong

Unlike most other Seder-Masochism scenes I've posted, this one isn't primarily parody; the overall message is similar to that of the song. I still argue it's Fair Use, and transformative. Parody isn't the only way to transform (nor is transformation the only criterion for Fair Use). "Go Down Moses" itself was transformative without being parody: it made Exodus into a story of American slavery. Creativity is complicated and shouldn't be dictated by lawyers. LET MY PEOPLE GO!

DESCRIPTION :'Family Portrait' is the product of a three day workshop with Chinese artist Lei Lei at the Royal College of Art. The task was to create a real or imagined family portrait based on family photos, old magazines and voice recordings. Despite our group members being from Taiwan, Singapore, Ukraine, Belgium and Germany, we found one international thing that all our families had in common - an eccentric or awkward relative. 

This story is based on true events.

Thank you Gretel, you were the most entertaining grandma!&nbsp;

TITLE :Chasing Space
AUTHOR :Marco Bagni LostConversation

YEAR :01/01/1970
DESCRIPTION :So we have this process, called life, it's aware of itself, it's aware of itself through you, you are an instrument through which the Universe looks at itself.
The Universe is looking at itself through you, and because of this there is always an aspect of itself that it can't see.

Like a snake pursuing his own tale.

That's what we find as we investigate the Universe:
Make the microscope bigger and bigger, and we will find ever more minute things;
Make the telescope bigger and bigger, and the Universe expands, because it's running away from itself;

It won't do that if you don't chase it!

You cannot take the whole of it, but you can get rid of it!

People around you will do the utmost to persuade you that you are missing something, because they are missing something and they think they are getting it, through a certain way; and therefore, to assure theirselves, they like you to do it too!

TITLE :Electro Boogie
AUTHOR :Radio Design
LICENSE :Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs License
YEAR :01/01/1970
DESCRIPTION :Radio Design toasts 10 years of animation with a robot reboot.

In May 2014, Radio Design celebrates its 10th birthday. From our early years creating TV titles for BBC and Channel 4 to more recent work on the 007 Skyfall movie, it&rsquo;s been quite a journey. To commemorate our 10 years in the industry we&rsquo;ve revisited a favourite early animation and given it the full 2014 reboot treatment. Ladies and Gentleman, may we present the all new Electro Boogie.

Onedotzero screened Electro Boogie at the launch of their monthly event #dotdotdot on 24th July 2014.
http://onedotzero.com/projects/dotdotdot

Creative Director, Ben Cook, explains the process:

&ldquo;These little guys kick-started the career over a decade ago. It seemed only fitting to reboot the robots for the Radio Design 10 year anniversary. The process, however, wasn&rsquo;t all that simple &ndash; since the original version had been created as a 400x400px flash movie. There was no way these were going to look good in a full HD movie. I had to delve back into the project files saved on an old 2001 iMac G3, modelled in Poser 3.0 &ndash; it was like time travelling, and I&rsquo;d completely forgotten how to use OS9. I experimented with export options but the old Poser 3.0 wireframe mode used to give that stylised box effect for the robots didn&rsquo;t like being translated into OBJ sequences, so there was no way of importing them into Cinema 4D. Back to the drawing board. Undeterred, I used a workaround which involved creating several passes of the robot animation sequence at different camera angles, exporting from Poser as very large greyscale Quicktime movies with alpha channels, and compositing them in After Effects. So the final effect isn&rsquo;t real 3D, although it&rsquo;s almost convincing, it&rsquo;s actually the trusty After Effects 2.5D. I used the camera cuts to switch to a new quicktime movie at a different angle to spoof the effect. An additional challenge was the floor. Initially it was set up as a large shape layer with very thin strokes, but I found this created problems. Not only did it really hog the processor for previews, but the quality of the lines was quite poor when they disappeared into the distance, and were undesirably thick in the foreground, even at the tiniest stroke width. I turned to Plexus 2 in the end, importing an OBJ and using the inbuilt lines and points renderers in the plug-in. The results were infinitely better and even though I didn&rsquo;t need to use the animation power of Plexus for the floor, it&rsquo;s real-time generative speed kept the rendering to a minimum and the lines crisp and clean. Lastly were the lighting effects. I&rsquo;m indebted to the Video Copilot tutorial on Volumetric Light, the technique I used for the disc up-lighters. Also essential to the animation&rsquo;s success was the Video Copilot plug-in Element 3D, which I used for the light floor &lsquo;tubs&rsquo; and the title sequence. Several months later, after some heavy compositing, sound design and a final colour grade &ndash; voila! Electro Boogie mk.II.&rdquo;

Here&rsquo;s where it all began. The original Electro Boogie made over 10 years ago. Not too shabby, even though he&rsquo;s getting on a bit:

DESCRIPTION :2 Weeks Creative Workshop by Tomas Roda / Motionwip & Avneesh / electroca&iuml;ne

Video Mapping Project.

Dans le silence de l&rsquo;ombre, sur un tapis de poussi&egrave;res, jaillit la lumi&egrave;re. Dans le ventre du th&eacute;&acirc;tre les &eacute;motions fusent, le d&ocirc;me se m&eacute;canise et les balcons s&rsquo;&eacute;lectrisent. La sc&egrave;ne est spectatrice de sa salle, gorg&eacute;e de couleurs. Un man&egrave;ge mystique, un ballet animalesque qui emporte &agrave; la fronti&egrave;re de l&rsquo;imaginaire. A l&rsquo;or&eacute;e d&rsquo;une douce nuit o&ugrave; le r&ecirc;ve est v&eacute;cu les yeux ouverts. Un passage vers l&rsquo;ailleurs, l&agrave; o&ugrave; la magie est r&eacute;elle &agrave; travers la pupille du r&ecirc;veur. Une ode &agrave; l'enfance, une illusion de jeux d'ombres. Le th&eacute;&acirc;tre respire, enfin un peu de lumi&egrave;re.

English version
The Wind
Back then, there was a drunk man who fall down wherever he went. He even got inside some houses.One day, he stepped on a cornfield and destroyed it.He went on and knocked down whatever was on his way: trees, houses, and every parcel of land. He was considered a worker in this world because that drunk man became the wind, that&rsquo;s why now the wind wanders around as he pleases. Just like the drunk man who used to destroyed everything on its way. Since then, that drunk man is the wind we feel.

AUTHOR :Jonathan Van Roosbeke

YEAR :01/01/1970
DESCRIPTION :It all started in 2015 when  J&eacute;r&eacute;mie Douchy and Jer&ocirc;me Gobin went in Iceland for their holydays bringing all their filming gear. They came back with a huge amount of footage and asked Jonathan if he would be interested in doing something with those footage. He reached Paul to know if he wanted to be part of it and it all began...

After derushing and deciding wich of the shots were usable for a short Jonathan and Paul wrote a script (a very short script more a plot than a script actually) and they made an animation preview... Being huge fans of Sci-fi the film mood was easy to choose. 
After agreeing on the animation preview they reached Jacob to design the score and he was given a free hand on his part of the project.

This project was entirely made on our spare time between commercial projects over the course of less than one year. This project was made unpretentious just for fun and was an excuse to test new techniques and softs.

We all hope you enjoyed it and thanks for watching !

Half asleep with my eyes closed, my conscience flies beyond time and space and I transform myself to all the life forms existing. I become the universe and the universe becomes me, until I fall asleep.... It is a song to pray for the existence of heart and soul at an awakening.

YEAR :01/01/1970
DESCRIPTION :In conjunction with the Malaysia Heritage Coke 2013 event in May 12 we had taken the opportunity to collaborate with a few mograph artists in creating a fun & exciting promo video.

The idea of the video was to showcase the Coca-cola glass bottle in a creative environment, similar to what Coca-cola worldwide has been coming up for their well-loved & creatively designed bottles and tin cans. We wanted to showcase how Coca-cola has been very creative with their designs through out the years.

Each artist were free to come up with their creative ideas revolving around the Coca-cola glass bottle. We then took the mographs given and edited the videos to create one promo video.

Thank you to everyone who were involved and making this happen.

TITLE :Ending Overfishing
AUTHOR :OCEAN2012
LICENSE :Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs License
YEAR :01/01/1970
DESCRIPTION :Despite an increased awareness of overfishing, the majority of people still know very little about the scale of the destruction being wrought on the oceans.  This film presents an unquestionable case for why overfishing needs to end and shows that there is still an opportunity for change. Through reform of the EU&lsquo;s Common Fisheries Policy, fisheries ministers and members of the European Parliament can end overfishing. But only if you pressure them.

DESCRIPTION :THE RETURN OF JOHN FRUM is the thesis project of christian schlaeffer at the university of applied sciences augsburg, faculty for design, 2010.

2D Photoshop and After Effects
3D 3dsmax and Zbrush
Compositing After Effects

John Frum, Messiah of polynesian Cargo Cults, returns as an astronaut and businessman to the postindustrial wasteland of the financial-service-economy. Together with a native, he sets out for a "conquest of the useless" &mdash; or something.^-^
then things get confused, and what begins as a journey turns into a trip far off the boundaries of so called "logic" and "meaning".
With a storyline initially based on the prophecies of the seemingly most syncretic, ridiculous and pointless religion in the world &mdash; though really not any more syncretic, ridiculous and pointless than any and all other religions &mdash; computer-aided handdrawn 2D animation and 2D-3D-hybrid background art celebrate a renaissance of the unconscious, free from the technocratic structuralism of our times.

Supermoine revient pour casser du viking !

La l&eacute;gende raconte que dans la r&eacute;gion du Bugey se trouve une myst&eacute;rieuse abbaye. Maintes fois assaillie par des hordes de guerriers sanguinaires, elle ne fut pourtant jamais conquise. Ses irr&eacute;ductibles moines semblent ne rien craindre, ils fabriquent une boisson dont la recette est encore aujourd'hui gard&eacute;e secr&egrave;te...
--

Supermoine is back to get the Vikings! 
Legend has it that a mysterious abbey of the Bugey county, many times assailed by blood-thirsty Vikings, never fell. Its indomitable monks are fearless, they brew a potion whose recipe is still a secret to this day...

TITLE :ESPERO? (HOPE?)
AUTHOR :Simone Giampaolo
LICENSE :Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs License
YEAR :01/01/1970
DESCRIPTION :Graduation film created at the National Centre for Computer Animation in Bournemouth (UK) by Simone Giampaolo, Yifan Hu and Henrik Linnes.

ESPERO? (HOPE?) is a humorous, entertaining but also educational animated comedy which sarcastically shows how Gaia, our planet Earth, met humankind years and years ago, and all the problems which followed. A criticism of our modern society and of the way we've been "evolving" over the centuries. Apart from having a quite original visual style, ESPERO? (HOPE?) is also the very first 3D animated film fully dubbed in Esperanto, a beautiful universal language created over a hundred years ago to foster peace and international understanding between people.

Making of "ESPERO? (HOPE?)": https://vimeo.com/72011634

TITLE :Giant Episode 2 Sun
AUTHOR :Celine&Yann
LICENSE :Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs License
YEAR :01/01/1970
DESCRIPTION :The second episode of the Giant's Serie is finally finished!

As we said before, each episode will have a different Giant. This one is the story of "The Giant Sun" and his lost ray beam.
The idea is to travel through the world of the Giant and discover the untold truth about them and their conflicts with the human being.
You can discover below some pictures of the (futur) others Giants.

Special Big thanks to David Kamp for his great sound ;)
And also big thanks to Passion Pictures people, who give us a good and warm place to work on our personal projects, with a proper desk... niceee!

Those 2 first episodes were autoproduced, we would love to keep on creating episodes. We're looking for someone who could help us on producing it. "We need you!" to keep on telling their stories.

TITLE :NICK IDs
AUTHOR :Plenty
LICENSE :Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs License
YEAR :01/01/1970
DESCRIPTION :After winning the pitch (together with FunJob) for the creation of the new idents for NICK, we jumped into an ambitious project by proposing an idea based on a mix of techniques to obtain a different result. That&rsquo;s how we set out to create each ident by using the frame-by-frame animation technique first and then modelling each of them in 3D. This gave the idents a handmade appearance and allowed us to win absolute freedom in the transitions. All of this was based on an extremely minimalistic art direction and a set of great characters designed by FunJob, and received the finishing touch with the spectacular audio created by Norman Bambi.

DESCRIPTION :Reine repr&eacute;sente une approche, un trait&eacute; sur la maladie mentale qu&rsquo;est la schizophr&eacute;nie.
La part int&eacute;rieure d&rsquo;un malade et non la fa&ccedil;on dont il est per&ccedil;u par le monde qui l&rsquo;entoure.

C&rsquo;est en arrivant sur Paris que m&rsquo;est venu l&rsquo;id&eacute;e d&rsquo;interpr&eacute;ter cette maladie &agrave; travers le motion design.

Etant originaire d&rsquo;un petit village dans les Pyr&eacute;n&eacute;es, ce genre de pathologie n&rsquo;est pas commun &agrave; l&rsquo;inverse des grandes villes o&ugrave; le stress l&rsquo;un des nombreux facteurs y est beaucoup plus pr&eacute;sent.

---------------

Reine represents an approach, a treaty on mental disease of schizophrenia.
The inner part of a patient and not how he is perceived by the world around him.

When I came in Paris, I had this idea to interpret this disease through motion design.

Being from a small village in the Pyrenees, this kind of pathology is not common unlike big cities where stress one of many factors is much more present.

DESCRIPTION :MFP, filiale du groupe France T&eacute;l&eacute;vision, a confi&eacute; &agrave; Goodideas la conception et la production d'un film institutionnel pour pr&eacute;senter ses trois m&eacute;tiers. Nous avons d&eacute;velopp&eacute; une &eacute;criture s'appuyant sur les valeurs de l'entreprise et en particulier sur le th&egrave;me de "sens", nous avons soutenu le discours &agrave; la fois &agrave; l'image en interpr&eacute;tant graphiquement l'id&eacute;e ; et &agrave; la fois au son en soulignant le motion design. L'ambition pour se film consistait &agrave; &ecirc;tre &agrave; la fois simple et &eacute;pur&eacute;, logique et coh&eacute;rent, modeste et exigeant. Au final, une po&eacute;sie visuelle qui surprend et convainc.

Written by Clara Lehmann
Edited by Jonathan Lacocque
Narrated by Kevin Tully
Sound Design by Shawn Wilson

Shod, saddled and champing at the bit,
I ride.
Through the dust, in the dark, on the open trail.
With a rhythm to each stride, I crave the dirt under hoof.
A mark on the landscape. A relic of my journey.
I trod, trample, gallop, and sprint. I press on.
The wind forever at my back, carries a secret across the mountains.
She whispers in my ear, "And die of nothing but a rage to live."
I ride to create. I ride for art.
I ride for Coat of Arms.

AUTHOR :Diana Lange

DESCRIPTION :Made with Processing.

With this example I focused highly on the calculation of the fish geometry which is realised mostly with vector math and the trigonometric functions. The movement itself has 3 options: 
Movement mode 1 = All fish try to reach the center
Movement mode 2 = All fish align along a noise field
Movement mode 3 = All fish align along a radial vector field

Sound is a mix of:

DESCRIPTION :This spring in the Stockholm City Hall we presented the audiovisual performance "Cognition" developed by our studio in collaboration with the composer and pianist Nikola Melnikov, specially for the brand Asko. The installation of "Cognition" is an expression of striving for the perfect shape. Everything can be perfect&ndash;whether it is a geometric figure or a person. The experience of perfection exists where people open themselves in external icons. We thank Asko Appliances AB for their trust and support in the implementation of the project.

The Main part of the effect are in 2D using motion vector and lighting from 3D

It was a real challenge for us  to work with an abstract animated face !
Enjoy !

TITLE :Animation Sequence Project
AUTHOR :Steffen K
LICENSE :Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike License
YEAR :01/01/1970
DESCRIPTION :The Animation Sequence Project is an unique co-creation project featuring the world&rsquo;s greatest animation artists.
Creative minds from all over the world are invited to create a short piece of animation. The only requirement for the content of the animation is that it starts and ends with a 250 pixel square in the exact middle of the screen.

 -

This is my contribution to the project.
I wanted to play with some techniques used in an earlier personal project, but keep a 2D feel using mostly shapes and lines - and a limited faded color palette.

Working after working, it is many people&rsquo;s life. No time for them to think, dream or even taking a rest. They work for money just like a machine. But where are your dream? Money can make you forgot your wish. Money can takes away all your time. Money can destroy your life. It is the life you are dreaming for?

Rethink your life!
The action is in your hand; you can change your life.

&ldquo;Soeng&rdquo;, a Cantonese direct translate of a Chinese character &ldquo;&#24819;&rdquo;. It means think, dream, believe and wish. Going to Soeng mean heading to your dream.

Soeng is now available on iTunes Store, support if you like it :)

DESCRIPTION :Another cool 76gfx 3D intro. This time with black color. The neon light effect was interesting to do with Element 3D by creating custom maps and playing with the UV mapping feature. Finally, some manual color channel bleeding effect to flavor it and make it taste better. 

This is the white and gold look

Facing the plots that we transformed from our observation of society, the leading role questioned the society and intended to do something at last. The leading role destroying herself by a pencil responds to we creating her by a pencil. It implies the control and repetition of the destiny.

TITLE :Helios - Short Film
AUTHOR :Juan Behrens
LICENSE :Attribution License
YEAR :01/01/1970
DESCRIPTION :&ldquo;Galileo was not the first person to invent the telescope but was the first to turn one toward the night sky&ldquo;

During the 17th century, the Roman Catholic church believed that the Earth was the center of the universe and those who tried to prove them wrong were in danger of being accused of heresy. Helios is the story of how an idea found his innovator, triggering a series of consequences in time. The date is 1609, Italy, late at night at Galileo Galilei&rsquo;s workplace. He is watching the sky, studying celestial bodies and focusing on the moon. He prepares to see this unexplored world with his customized telescope while some of his sketches and notes rest on the floor. After a gently approaching the telescope, he sees the moon through it &ndash;a celestial body full of enigmas and intrigues for any human eye. After a moment, a bright light invades the scene around him, but he does not notice it. This light resembles the silhouette of the invention, this enigmatic form splits into three muses.

These three muses approach Galileo and start touching his back, resting next to him and pointing to the sky. Galileo starts watching the moon differently. He starts spotting data that he had not seen before, now seeming to understand how the moon works and why. He draws what he sees and repares himself to present this to cardinal Bellarmine at church, in order, to prove that the Earth is not the center of the universe, but orbits around the Sun, just like the Moon around the Earth.

Galileo&rsquo;s discovery fundamentally alters the way humans perceive themselves in the
cosmos.

A project commissioned by La Nuit des Images 2015 x Mus&eacute;e de l'Elys&eacute;e, Lausanne, Switzerland.
www.nuitdesimages.org

&darr;
The garden has always been a space where actual and imaginary stories collide: a place of random or secret encounters, where fantasmagoria arises at night. The garden is also a gateway to multiple temporalities and living entities, where young and old humans interact with each other, under the look of centuries-old trees which remind us the quiet flow of time. A small mirror in which the world reflects.

Future Ruins is a site-specific installation designed for the garden of the Mus&eacute;e de l'Elys&eacute;e in Lausanne, Switzerland, which combines digital projection on the main facade of the museum with 12 illuminated aluminium structures in the shape of architectural elements from the building at scale 1:1, spread on the ground in a random order. The installation also features an 8-channel soundtrack.

Both technological objects and from neoclassical inspiration, these structures are some potential remains of our world, suspended in time. 
They collapsed, but they still light up the night.

TITLE :GOLDEN AGE - SOMEWHERE
AUTHOR :Paul Nicholls
LICENSE :Attribution-NonCommercial License
YEAR :01/01/1970
DESCRIPTION :OFFICIAL SELECTION: Vimeo Awards 2012 (experimental category last 4), Soho shorts, Onedotzero, Alphaville.

Within 'Somewhere' We are transported to a time where the boundaries between what is real and what is simulated are blurred. We live online and download places to relax, parks and shopping malls. We can even interact with our friends as if they were in the same room with simulated tele-presence. Everyone is connected and immersed in nanorobotic replications of any kind of object or furnishings, downlodable on credit based systems. Distance and time become as alien as the 'offline' The local becomes the global and the global becomes the local. Consumer based capitalism has changed forever. A truly 'glocolised' world. The singularity is near. 

The film places us into this vision, observing an average inhabitant within the ever changing environment of the latest SimuHouse. From a painting to a park and from a telephone call to a shopping mall. That is until there is a leek in the system and everything malfunctions. The film concludes with the house being forced to reset, giving the character and viewer a stark reminder that nothing is 'real' even her dog, which re-materialises in front of her.

TITLE :Army Rage :: Cinematic Trailer
AUTHOR :Zblur

YEAR :01/01/1970
DESCRIPTION :We had the chance to be responsible for the making of all cinematic trailers for online FPS game 'Army Rage'.
We made two videos for the half of the major classes of soldiers engaged in WWII shooter. From this material, we have put together one official extended trailer.
The idea was to prepare something like a realistic version of the game. Our greatest challenge was to make original characters move and look as natural as possible. All the work (except for some basic models from the game) was made  by two persons only.
Yacuba team were very impressed and excited of the result.

TITLE :2012 Yeosu EXPO HYUNDAI MOTOR GROUP _ Hyper-Matrix
AUTHOR :media artist group: jonpasang
LICENSE :Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike License
YEAR :01/01/1970
DESCRIPTION :Hyper-Matrix is a kinetic landscape installation created for the Hyundai Motor Group Exhibition Pavilion in Korea, the 2012 Yeosu EXPO site. The installation consists of a specially made huge steel construction to support thousands of stepper motors that control 320x320mm cubes that project out of the internal facade of the building. The foam cubes are mounted to actuators that move them forward and back by the steppers, creating patterns across the three-sided display. Comprised of what at first appear to be three blank white walls, Hyper-Matrix installation quickly comes to life as thousands of individual cubic units forming a field of pixels begin to move, pulsate, and form dynamic images across the room, creating infinite number of possibilities in the vertical, 180 degree, landscape. In addition, as the boxes are arranged at only 5mm narrow intervals, the wall can also be a nice moving screen for the images projected on to it.

DESCRIPTION :How do you take the actual Bloomberg platform screens, dense with financial tools, data and analytics and bring them to life in a slick 2 minute video? I think we can be proud - Aggressive came-up with a clever visual trick ultimately designing an entire world using the financial data itself. Finance made cool. 

Tip: Set to the James Bond theme track, it reads like a 007 movie-opener.

TITLE :H A B I T A T
AUTHOR :Oskar F.
LICENSE :Attribution License
YEAR :01/01/1970
DESCRIPTION :H A B I T A T  is the result of one year worth of rejected ideas, workflows and assets that never made it to fruition as a commercial project.
 
As far as design goes an art director has to go against his own tastes opting for the best interpretation. A great chunk of these projects don't even make it through the research and development phase, which does not speak for the works own quality. This project represents a homage to all the rejected and disregarded ideas that culminate in a creative persons everyday life. Contentwise the project deals with the topographic presentation of various objects and motions, in order to create a language of form which grows organically whilst sustaining the aspects of its technical construction.

I sought out to capture the electric radiance of Los Angeles at night and paint a portrait of my city.

It took me 6 months of on and off shooting to finish this project.

Shooting time lapses is a labor of love and a study in patience.

This video is dedicated to the memory of my Grandmother.

TITLE :a rather short history of (believable) CG characters in movies
AUTHOR :Paul Blaudschun
LICENSE :Attribution License
YEAR :01/01/1970
DESCRIPTION :UPDATE 05/28/2012:
exchanged source video for 720p version, no big changes to the content, only small corrections to framing (4:3 --16:9), audio cleanup and 2 or 3 small changes to the edit.
due to the 500MB upload limit for free members the bitrate is still rather low at 3200, so don't expect a massive quality boost....
i also changed the title and added "rather" and "(believable)" to clear up some misunderstandings as to why i didn't add this or that ;)
---
it's a little rough around the edges and could have used a day or two to refine the content, but i guess it's informative enough to share.

DESCRIPTION :&#9733; Winner of BassAwards 2016: Best Showreel. 

This is a montage of the best projects I worked on in the last year or two, when I've been mostly a full time animator at Buck LA. Of course, all due credit to that amazing team. 

The soundtrack for the montage is a piece of music called Fire At the San, composed by Rachel Portman & David Snell for the movie The Road to Wellville. The soundtrack is for reference only, not for commercial purposes. 

For the intro and outro I used the Canter Typeface from the Fontfabric Type Foundry. It was designed by Christopher J. Lee, New York, USA.

All projects directed by Buck, except for 0:03 and 1:06 (self-promotional) and 1:08 (directed by State Design).
Thanks for watching!

TITLE :Corporate Coitus
AUTHOR :bestbefore
LICENSE :Attribution-NonCommercial License
YEAR :01/01/1970
DESCRIPTION :Corporate Coitus // From the CD Giraffes
Andreas Karaoulanis: animation (http://www.bestbefore.gr)
David Hahn: audio (http://www.davidhahnonline.com/)

"I composed Corporate Coitus while working as an audio technician at a company which produced background music for businesses. When the company CEO was interviewed by the on-line business journal WallStreetReporter.com, I used the audio portion of the interview as source material. I extracted the extra-verbal sounds&mdash;the &ldquo;ahs&rdquo; and &ldquo;ums&rdquo; and intakes of breath&mdash;for use in this new piece. The title of Corporate Coitus came about as I feel that sex and business are always somehow connected. 
I heard the piece as an imaginary sex act gathering intensity to a climax followed by a gradual de-tumescence."

TITLE :Digital Tailoring "Scroll yourself up" animation movie
AUTHOR :Alfaiataria Digital
LICENSE :Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs License
YEAR :01/01/1970
DESCRIPTION :www.Alfaiataria.net is a creative Brazilian Interactive Studio.

This is the video promo crafted for our new website release, last June 2009. Hand drawn with Flash and After Effects post-production.

A little bit about our studio:
In just 6 years, we have grown to become the most traditional interactive studio in Brazil. And don&acute;t think we had an easy time getting here using the most cutting edge technology and design artwork. We are traditional because we stick to the old school method of working. We treat each client as unique, not like a part of an assembly line.

Our production line is like a tailor's sewing needle, weaving fine crafted marketing plans and digital campaigns. We create brand identity projects, promotional websites, multimedia presentations, e-Commerce and e-Business sites, one by one. However great craftsmen we may be, we will never become a large or modern studio. We prefer how things were done in the old days: patiently looking at details from up close, paying attention to every drawn pixel.

Sewing pixels since 2003.

TITLE :Model and Render a Diamond in Maya tutorial
AUTHOR :FermiCG

YEAR :01/01/1970
DESCRIPTION :Rendering a realistic looking diamond in Maya is little bit trickier.In this tutorial I have used Mental ray for rendering but used default Blinn material for shading.I didn't used any lights,caustics,HDR map,final gather or global illumination for this scene.The final glow is achieved by After effects.In after effects I used Default glow because I want to show with in our limit we can make some thing good like this.If you have Sapphire plug ins use it wisely for getting some real glows.I skipped lighting for this scene because the same reason, I want to show that it is possible in this way too.

Utilizing poetic storytelling, the script allowed us to explore the visuals creatively in design and animation. We wanted to breathe life into the environments and have an illustration style that was unique and interesting. We also enhanced the visuals by mixing 3D and 2D elements into the world. Enjoy!

TITLE :Japanese Graphics Now!
AUTHOR :rafael araújo
LICENSE :Attribution License
YEAR :01/01/1970
DESCRIPTION :Japan aesthetics is unique, creative and their point of view reflects in all fields of design, like prints, typography, advertisements, products, animation.

This is my personal project based on the book Japanese Graphics Now! 
originally published by Taschen, by the authors Julius Wiedemann and Gisela Kozak.
      
Process. Choose some arts and animate in a way that I could express what I feel, without paying much attention about the original meaning, done in an experimental and exercise mode.

Randomness. The result is an abstract non-linear compilation, with my perspective on something that was not very clear, just trying matching the animation with the visual style.

AUTHOR :Zblur

YEAR :01/01/1970
DESCRIPTION :We had the chance to be responsible for the making of all cinematic TV spots and trailers for online FPS game 'Army Rage'.
For this project we made four video editings: 10, 15, 20 and 30 seconds.
This time the idea was to prepare even more realistic version of the game. The intensity and the scale of the stages were also increased. All the work (except for some basic models from the game) was made by two persons only.
Yacuba team were very impressed and excited of the result again.

TITLE :Hold
AUTHOR :mwmotion
LICENSE :Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs License
YEAR :01/01/1970
DESCRIPTION :Hold is a short film about the Hold keyframe and its power to stop motion. Hold wants nothing more than to join in with the other keyframes but unfortunately, his ability to stop motion interrupts, forcing him to become an outcast. Eventually, Hold shows the other keyframes that being different is okay and they begin to grow an appreciation for his unique talent allowing him to join in with the fun.

The film takes a geeky stance on the classic underdog story, making the viewer feel sympathetic toward our hero and hoping for him to succeed. 

Non-animators may wonder what the Hold character is based on. On a basic level, the Hold Keyframe is a tool within animation programs allowing animators to ensure that objects or characters remain static for a desired period of time. 

I hope you enjoy watching my short film.

DESCRIPTION :Second video from the album NO GROUND UNDER (Ninja Tune) for Ghislain Poirier.

Putting images on the music of this Montreal artist was a big challenge. Bass, a mechanical construction, and a lot more Bass. The creative process was the same as Poirier&rsquo;s during the musical composition: a perpetual multiplication of elements to build a unique world.

TITLE :Kurt Vile - Life Like This
AUTHOR :adam avilla
LICENSE :Attribution-NonCommercial License
YEAR :01/01/1970
DESCRIPTION :"Life Like This" is a story about getting at the heart of inspiration and the surreal disjointed journey that the pursuit entails. 
Aimee Bender, a novelist, once said, &ldquo;As a writer, you ask yourself to dream while awake.&rdquo; I feel that artists of all disciplines can relate to such a notion of getting pleasantly (or sometimes unpleasantly) lost in your own thoughts, and from them reap inspiration for our best work.

YEAR :01/01/1970
DESCRIPTION :To some people, their morning routine of drinking coffee is critical to how the rest of their day will go. It is a fun subject matter to explore, so I did kinetic type piece on the benefits of coffee for the consumer. I didn't spend too much time hashing out facts for the piece. Instead, I focused on the fun subject matter, and treated the type as a form of caffeine. Sit yourself down, grab that cup of joe, and enjoy.

TITLE :Rapidez[EL MUNDO EVOLUCIONA]_Rapidity [THE WORLD EVOLVES]
AUTHOR :Diego Gómez
LICENSE :Attribution-ShareAlike License
YEAR :01/01/1970
DESCRIPTION :Rapidez[EL MUNDO EVOLUCIONA]

ESPA&Ntilde;OL-SPANISH

"La Rapidez es una virtud que engendra un vicio, LA PRISA"

la gente tiene esta virtud aunque algunas personas lo sienten como un defecto.
A mi manera de ver el mundo, pienso que la aceleraci&oacute;n crea evoluci&oacute;n. 

Y de eso vivimos los humanos. Si molestarnos por lo que da&ntilde;amos a nuestro alrededor.

INGLES-ENGLISH

Rapidity [THE WORLD EVOLVES]

"The Rapidity is a virtue that generates a vice, THE HURRY"

The people have this virtue though some persons feel it as a fault.
To my way of seeing the world, I think that the acceleration creates evolution.  
And of it we live the human beings. If not to bother for what we damage to ours around.

TITLE :DISFORM 2012
AUTHOR :Dani Wolf
LICENSE :Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs License
YEAR :01/01/1970
DESCRIPTION :The signage system of the alternative music festival DISFORM 2012 has two purposes: to direct the audience, informing where each area is located; and to enrich the whole experience of the festival itself, by creating an engaging dialogue between the signs 
and their surroundings.

The animation and the editing are directly affected by the live music performances, using OpenGL technology. The additional layer of information is dynamic and updated in real-time in order to help the audience of the festival.

My graduation project for the Bezalel Academy of Design and Arts / 2012

TITLE :Escape from Syria - Faiza's story
AUTHOR :Bullion
LICENSE :Attribution-NonCommercial License
YEAR :01/01/1970
DESCRIPTION :After visiting Jordan last year I interviewed a Syrian Refugee who fled across the border from Syria with her two children. I asked her young children to draw pictures of their journey.

This animation takes inspiration from the children's drawings and uses the voice-over of their mother Faiza to tell their story. It hopefully also highlights the shocking numbers of displaced children along with the large numbers of Syrian people who simply just &lsquo;disappear&rsquo; under the Assad Regime.

AUTHOR :Aggressive

YEAR :01/01/1970
DESCRIPTION :We created three spots to celebrate Boeing&rsquo;s 100th anniversary. Executed using seamless design and hyper-real CG, we drew inspiration from engineering blueprints, as each spot captures the awe-inspiring process that starts with a single spark in the mind of a Boeing engineer, and finishes with a gravity defying roar of an engine taking a machine to unprecedented altitudes. From the historical, 1916 B&W plane to the 787 Dreamliner, Boeing products come alive, celebrating 100 years of technological triumphs in Space, Defense and Commercial travel.

The concept behind the show was video game backgrounds, taking inspiration from classic fighting games I created 10 settings that each loosely correlated to a different track from Aa.

This content was projected and shown on screens and appeared more abstracted in a physical show setting.

DESCRIPTION :What will it take to make us act on climate change? Why can&rsquo;t we overcome our collective inertia? Intellectually we may &lsquo;get it&rsquo;, but our behaviour doesn&rsquo;t always reflect that fact. Searching for a more powerful, emotive way into the problem, we commissioned BRIT-nominated George the Poet to write a brand-new piece to awaken us from our toxic slumbers.

TITLE :Pause 2017 Opening Titles - Different Perspective by Zaoeyo & Echoic
AUTHOR :Pause Fest
LICENSE :Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs License
YEAR :01/01/1970
DESCRIPTION :This year's theme of Pause is "Different Perspective".

The whole idea was inspired by an anime called "Digimon Adventure", whose opening scenes show the different angle of a night city and digital creatures.
Therefore, we decide to focus on a different angle or perspective of empty cities, to express a feeling of isolation, despite the fact we live in these spaces. 
The idea of using a cat for guidance is borrowed from an indie game called "HK", which will enhance the feeling of isolation between human and their environment.

DESCRIPTION :Up higher than you&rsquo;ve ever been, past the third cloud to the right and straight on towards the sun, lies a world of wonder and excitement &ndash; a place where young and old can play in the clouds, spinning and whooshing like never before. We hope you have fun and enjoy the rides!

Makerie Studio and Director Andr&eacute; Gidoin have teamed up again to create a surreal world of paper wonder, this time high in an imaginary sky. The Fantastical Fairground is a fully functional set, created from a combination of paper and found vintage toys, which we injected with new life and fresh colours. Filmed over the course of yet another weekend in New York, the Fairground also features pieces brought to life by chains, cogs and old childhood favourites - Meccano motors.

Marcus Loeber created the score to the video, once again bringing his incredible talent to the table - this time with the help of Cosma & Emelie, who sing along to the track in the same lighthearted tone as the fairground itself.

Special thanks to Kris Paulsen who helped us on set. Couldn't have made this without you!

TITLE :Death Loves Life
AUTHOR :Coat of Arms
LICENSE :Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs License
YEAR :01/01/1970
DESCRIPTION :Young and beautiful, Life is enthralled with the world around her. Death is enamored by Life's innocence and vivacity, but his attempts to connect with her are fleeting. Despite Death&rsquo;s awkward and destructive path, Life recovers from each loss with graceful fortitude. In Death&rsquo;s gloom, a passionate love for Life blossoms.

This very short film was conceived by Clara Lehmann & Jonathan Lacocque, and completed nights and weekends from 2014 to 2015. It's our first short narrative and was an experiment to see whether we could pull it off, and to begin the process of working on more narrative projects in the future.  We hope you enjoy!

TITLE :mon rêve
AUTHOR :cento lodigiani
LICENSE :Attribution License
YEAR :01/01/1970
DESCRIPTION :There is a kind of cult in the world, made of men and women of all social backgrounds, of all ages, races and religions. It's the sect of the sleepless. I am part of it. The men who do not belong to the sect sometimes say to those who are part of: 'if you can not sleep you can still read, watch TV, study or do anything else'. This kind of tips deeply bother components of the sect of insomniacs. The reason is very simple: those who suffer from insomnia has only one obsession: to fall asleep.
helped by references to some of the greatest masters of surrealism,  and starring Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Chopin's  nocturne for this new short, I tried to show the beauty and the  purity of dreams, and the bizarre behavior of our images and thoughts flow, into them. 

AUDIO RECOMMENDED!

TITLE :"Breaking The Ice"
AUTHOR :Travis Robertson
LICENSE :Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs License
YEAR :01/01/1970
DESCRIPTION :It&rsquo;s safe to say that no professional sports team has ever advertised themselves by partnering with a world-renowned animator to create a series of completely random, highly ridiculous, hand-drawn, single-cell animated shorts in the styling of cartoons from the 70&rsquo;s and 80&rsquo;s.

That is, until now. When the NHL&rsquo;s Boston Bruins teamed up with J.J. Sedelmaier (of SNL TV Funhouse fame) to create &ldquo;The Bear & the Gang: Animated Shorts&rdquo; featuring the Boston Bruins players, personalities and some utterly ridiculous scenarios.

Each episode puts the gang in a series of strange and hilarious adventures filled with falcons, lasers, space travel, jet packs, helicopters and even soft-serve-ice-cream-dispensing homemade robots.

The characters were voiced by the actual Boston Bruins players and even featured a special guest appearance by the Mayor of Boston.

And in keeping with the cartoons from the 70&rsquo;s and 80&rsquo;s, each episode ends with &ldquo;Bruins Cop&rdquo;. A Bruins-themed police officer who, much like Woodsy the Owl, and McGruff the Crime Dog, offers up helpful&mdash; and increasingly random&mdash; tips for a better life.

TITLE :I can't go on, I'll go on
AUTHOR :B K
LICENSE :Attribution-ShareAlike License
YEAR :01/01/1970
DESCRIPTION :I can't go on, I'll go on...

This piece is based on the famous and inspiring last sentence from Samuel Beckett's 'The Unnameable'.
Combining existential musings and the plight of Sisyphus, it is a meditation on (as Shakespeare would cast it) '...the question..'.
Ambivalence, conviction, certainty, endless toil, futility, purpose and the lack thereof... such is life.


'I can't go on, I'll go on...' is an excerpt from '26 Suicides'.

26 Suicides is a 27 chapter, non-narrative new media art work. 

**26 Suicides was initially designed to use surround sound and multi channel video to deliver an enveloping, synesthetic experience.  26 Suicides is currently being remixed as a virtual reality art experience.**

It is the personal and intimate testimony of my synesthetic life. The 26 Suicides installation uses 10 audio (surround) sound channels and 8 video channels to deliver an enveloping, synesthetic experience. The videos here on Vimeo are excerpts. They are single channel video with stereo audio, offering a taste of the installation.

Watch them if you are not afraid of dangerous modern art.

The compression on Vimeo has squished most of the goodness out of this work, if you are interested, ask me about getting the high-res version.

'You must go on.
I can't go on.
You must go on.
I'll go on.

You must say words, as long as there are any - until they find me, until they say me. 
(Strange pain, strange sin!) You must go on. Perhaps it's done already.
Perhaps they have said me already.
Perhaps they have carried me to the threshold of my story, before the door that opens on my story.
(That would surprise me, if it opens.)

It will be I? 
It will be the silence, where I am?
I don't know, I'll never know: in the silence you don't know.

You must go on.
I can't go on.
I'll go on.'

TITLE :Malaysia Coca-Cola Collectors Fair 2015 #MYMASHUPCOKE
AUTHOR :Glassfin
LICENSE :Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike License
YEAR :01/01/1970
DESCRIPTION :90 Designs, 51 Artists, 1 Video

In conjunction with the Malaysia 5th Annual Coca-Cola Collectors Fair, we were once again given the opportunity to collaborate with MCCC to produce a promo video for the event that is happening on the 9th of May 2015.

2015 is the 100th anniversary of the Coca-Cola contour bottle, so we used the contour bottle as our theme for the promo video. We also wanted to show the vast Malaysian art field, and decided to have a &lsquo;Call for Artists&rsquo; inviting any interested Malaysian artists to collaborate with us. Fortunately, the response that we got was more than what we&rsquo;d expected, and in the end we had 51 artists joining us on this project.

Each artists were given freedom on creating their artwork. The only rule: the contour bottle has to be distinguishable and placed at the center of the screen. And oh, no political & religious issues.

Here is the final video that was made out of each and every one of the collaborator&rsquo;s love for art. We couldn&rsquo;t have done this without you, thank you!

This is PURELY a NON-PROFIT VIDEO for the event.

Spread the word around! #MYMASHUPCOKE

TITLE :CARE "Power of a Box"
AUTHOR :Hue&Cry
LICENSE :Attribution License
YEAR :01/01/1970
DESCRIPTION :It&rsquo;s always tough to tell a brand&rsquo;s story. It&rsquo;s even tougher when the story spans 70 years of evolution and progress. But the toughest part about telling this story was truly honoring one of the oldest and greatest humanitarian foundations on the globe.&rsquo;Power of a Box&rsquo; touches on the history, the evolution and the sheer scope of the work that the CARE Foundation has been delivering since the first half of last century, an effort that has improved the lives of a billion people in 90 countries around the world.

Then we took it another step. The core message and visuals of &rsquo;Power of a Box&rsquo; have been translated to an additional :30 and :15, as well as print, digital and social medias to create a new campaign for CARE. Our hope is that an organization that was at one point the &lsquo;go to&rsquo; for humanitarian contribution will again become a house hold name that people know and trust, and we look forward to continuing to push their message and help them deliver lasting change.

DESCRIPTION :'Aaseriya', the title of the show is an evening based cooking show which will be airing during month of Ramadan on Al Rayyan Television. The Idea was inspired by one of the reference I have seen on internet but enhanced it to take it to make it even better. The kaleidoscopic view is the primary element of this experiment.

AUTHOR :NoBody
LICENSE :Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs License
YEAR :01/01/1970
DESCRIPTION :video by Bruno Luca Perrone - 2G & Sakshin
Immersed in a miniature set made of cardboard and plastic we follow a &ldquo;message/galleon&rdquo; in a bottle. The sea within and the sea without. Pollution, mental and symbolic, has substituted nature with inorganic elements. A mixture of animation techniques: stop motion, computer graphic and real-time unveil a vision of subtle perspective, always limited and fleeting.


Immersi in una scenografia in miniatura fatta di cartone e plastica, seguiamo un "messaggio/galeone" all'interno di una bottiglia. Un mare dentro e un mare fuori. L'inquinamento, mentale e simbolico, ha sostituito la natura con elementi inorganici. Una miscellanea di tecniche di animazione: "stop motion", "computer graphic" e "real-time" svelano una visione prospettica sottile, sempre limitata e fugace.

TITLE :Paul Weller - Long Long Road Official Lyric Video
AUTHOR :Joe Lea
LICENSE :Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs License
YEAR :01/01/1970
DESCRIPTION :The official lyric video to the single "Long Long Road" by Paul Weller

The video follows a lone man as he walks the Long Long Road of life, and whilst doing so meets the love of his life. 
The film was created using the traditional "Paint on Glass" animation technique, in which I animated all of the elements separately (Man, Woman, Letters, etc...) on a piece on glass with oil paints and stencils, which was set up underneath a camera and captured using Dragonframe. These plates were then keyed and composited together in After Effects to create the final video.

About the Movie

&ldquo;The music video tells the story of an office worker who is struggling to attract the girl of his dreams, a coworker. The question posed is this. Are his colleagues and his daily office tasks the obstacle in fulfilling his dream or rather, the dream itself?&rdquo;

About the Project

&ldquo;Coco de Elevador&rdquo; is a music video for a Brazilian DJ, Chico Correa. It&rsquo;s part of the &ldquo;Cria Cultura&rdquo; initiative to help both brazilian musicians and animators spread their work.

Director Paulo Passaro wanted to tell a story about everyday life with Chico Correa&rsquo;s music as it&rsquo;s dynamic soundtrack. People tend to think that their everyday lives are boring and their dreams are always better. That&rsquo;s why the music video is divided into three parts, each with a particular animation technique. The first one is &ldquo;real life&rdquo;, which is made using traditional 2D animation. The other two are &ldquo;the dream life&rdquo; which are made using two other types of animation, 2D animation in After Effects (CG) and Stop-Motion Animation. The purpose for using different animation techniques was not only to make the video more interesting but also to contrast our dreams to our everyday lives.

DESCRIPTION :In May, Asterisk came back to Casey Latiolais and I to budget for a new cell phone reveal video for the Huawei P8 Lite. We worked out a month for this project and 2 weeks later the client came back with "we need it June 1st. This meant that we would have to start immediately, it was May 20th.

Casey and I spit out 12 concept frames for 4 different ideas and sent them off on the 21st for approval. The next day we got word to move forward with one of our darker, sleeker concepts. That's what we did.  We hired on Jeff Moberg to create the score and sound effects.

TITLE :"A Kiss From Tokyo" Theatrical trailer
AUTHOR :Stephane coedel
LICENSE :Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs License
YEAR :01/01/1970
DESCRIPTION :Official selection for best advertising at Annecy Festival 2010!!!

"A Kiss From Tokyo", Theatrical Trailer (1964) - Yuki 7 dashes around the world in hot pursuit of the tantalizingly tricky Diamond Eye, who is stealing parts and plans and leaving behind a path of murdered scientists in her quest to build a missile inside her volcanic lair.

I co-directed it with and for Kevin Dart.
This animation is a part of a promotional event about the release of Kevin's new book, "Seductive Espionage, the world of Yuki 7" which was released in summer 2009.
Kevin produced the graphics and I gave them life in After Effects.

I tried to catch what was typical about the vintage look of the movies from this period. Lighting, grain, old school Special Effects (car chase in a studio with background projected film, miniature sets), editing, old fashion transitions, Music, etc...
Cyrille Marchesseau created a great piece of music inspired by Laurie Johnson (The Avengers) and John Barry (James bond).

Order the book, "Seductive Espionage: The World of Yuki 7" from www.fleetstreetscandal.com

YEAR :01/01/1970
DESCRIPTION :Client: Activision / Treyarch

Spov began working with Activision and Treyarch almost 18 months ago, conducting initial design research and producing early concept art and animation tests.  

Current commercial and military technology prototypes were used for inspiration to develop screen graphics depicting how the world might be viewed in 2025.   From this emerging technology, Spov created a technical vision through which the global narrative could unfold as the player tries to make sense of tangled events and prevent an emerging catastrophe, put in motion by the games calculating villain, Raul Menendez.

YEAR :01/01/1970
DESCRIPTION :In conjunction with the Malaysia Heritage Coke 2013 event in May 12 we had taken the opportunity to collaborate with a few mograph artists in creating a fun & exciting promo video.

The idea of the video was to showcase the Coca-cola glass bottle in a creative environment, similar to what Coca-cola worldwide has been coming up for their well-loved & creatively designed bottles and tin cans. We wanted to showcase how Coca-cola has been very creative with their designs through out the years.

Each artist were free to come up with their creative ideas revolving around the Coca-cola glass bottle. We then took the mographs given and edited the videos to create one promo video.

Combining live action scenes with stunning CG environments, Aggressive continues to evolve the Bloomberg visual aesthetic while telling the story of a never-ending monitor surface. The glistening reflective terminal screen changes shapes, seamlessly morphing from one environment to another while showcasing a brand new arsenal of investing tools.

TITLE :Intro: From Cowboy To Astronaut
AUTHOR :Jeremy Fuksa
LICENSE :Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike License
YEAR :01/01/1970
DESCRIPTION :Over the past couple of years I've given a presentation to college students entitled "From Cowboy to Astronaut." 

This presentation details some of the things I've learned during the progression of my days as a student at Oklahoma State University all the way to my current job at Barkley in Kansas City.

Previously I would spend about 10 minutes giving my history.  I didn't like the amount of time that took, yet I felt I had some important bits of information to share. So, I condensed it all into this 2 minute introductory video.

Created in After Effects CS3 with a huge 6000x6000 stitched together Google map.

TITLE :City DNA
AUTHOR :Jonathan Van Roosbeke
LICENSE :Attribution License
YEAR :01/01/1970
DESCRIPTION :I always wanted to create something related to DNA, I find this mesmerising. I start  my DNA setup, search several texture, camera angle and I found it a bit poor. So I made some basic sketches, and I found an idea :
The idea is that this "technological" DNA gives energy  to this big city and overlooks the city like a big monolith.
I wanted a city like when you look a motherboard. I mixed several sounds to create this strange atmosphere . That's the little story.

Software : C4D - Octane - After Effects.

DESCRIPTION :Dedicated to my own "tower".

- Night -
There is a door in the night that only the blind see,
&#8232;darkness makes the animals hear better,&#8232;
and him, staggered, not from being drunk, 
but from his futile effort to climb 
up to the tower, we once lost.

AUTHOR :rainasawrus
LICENSE :Attribution-ShareAlike License
YEAR :01/01/1970
DESCRIPTION :Octane Render Pack is a Cinema 4D .lib4d file with Materials and HDRI files . Every material has been designed for high quality photo realistic renders, that will make your motion design work and product pack shots look the best in the world. There are every possible material styles available for any look you would like to get in place.

You will need the octane render standalone and the octane render cinema 4d plugin , which can be purchased here - http://render.otoy.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=7&t=29638

scene files used in the video are also included. Studio setups are included as well to quickly organize your scenes.

Most scene files were rendered between a time frame of 8 - 10 seconds per frame, on average. The maximum time taken per frame render was 4 minutes. The render times are directly dependent on materials used (glassy/reflective) and quality settings.

Compared to other render engines, octane render will make your renders look outstanding in a very short time, and allow post processing within Cinema 4D, reducing your work flow time, and increasing your productivity.

Octane Render Plugin for Cinema 4D is in beta, and is being developed by - aoktar

Some stone shaders and glass materials within the Octane Render Pack were made by - immortal-arts

AUTHOR :GhostQiao
LICENSE :Attribution-NonCommercial-ShareAlike License
YEAR :01/01/1970
DESCRIPTION :LONELY ME was at first 6 GIFs in winter 2014.I created them because I felt lonely and tough at that time.It is true me in reality.I think most people have more than one character,some may be the same as me,optimistic outside,but always feel lonely inside.It is not that hard to make friends,it is fewer and fewer people can be made friends with.Though we human beings are social animals,we need to live together,we need each other.It is said that we also born alone, die alone, we're actually alone all through life.So loneliness seems not so terrible and awful,but a sill need to be learned.Once you learn to enjoy your loneliness, you will spend more time thinking,about the meaning of life or something you never care before.That's how you grow up,become mature and real human,using brains thinking instead just living.

SINOPSYS
Metachaos, from Greek Meta (beyond) and Chaos (the abyss where the eternally-formless state of the universe hides), indicates a primordial shape of ameba, which lacks in precise morphology, and it is characterized by mutation and mitosis.
In fact the bodies represented in METACHAOS, even though they are characterized by an apparently anthropomorphous appearance, in reality they are without identity and conscience. They exist confined in a spaceless and timeless state, an hostile and decadent hyperuranium where a fortress, in perpetual movement, dominates the landscape in defense of a supercelestial, harmonic but fragile parallel dimension. In its destructive instinct of violating the dimensional limbo, the mutant horde penetrates the intimacy of the fortress, laying siege like a virus. Similar to the balance of a philological continuum in human species, bringing the status of things back to the primordial broth.

STATEMENT
METACHAOS is a multidisciplinary audio-visual project, articulated in a short film, a set of photography (http://www.alessandrobavari.com/english/Metachaos-photographies/gallery_Metachaos-photographic_series.htm) and mix-technique paintings. The purpose of the project is to represent the most tragic aspects of the human nature and of its motion, such as war, madness, social change and hate. An accretion of feelings that are metaphorically represented by specific visual forms, which are abstract conceptually, but concrete and tangible formally. The application of acid and monochromatic tints, besides the strong contrasts, makes everything intentionally more oppressive and tragic. 

In order to obtain a more immersive and plausible version, the shot was taken adopting the camera live technique. The extreme and frenetic motion of the shoulder camera, similar to the subjective one, becomes a main constant, so that, along with the persisting cuts used to edit the video, create a bigger sense of instability and danger. In fact, thanks to the dissemination of Technology, it is possible to notice that the unconscious-esthetic potential of the shots available on Youtube, characterized by a pseudo-documentary and amateur approach, often offer an unexpected emotional involvement, which trigger an exhibitionistic-voyeuristic interchange between the author and the consumer.

The irrational gesture and action of the bodies, as if a collective form of madness controlled them, are inspired by artists like Bosch and Bruegel who, between the &lsquo;400 and &lsquo;500, produced an iconography where irrational images show sickly madness and pain. 

The project has been realized using different techniques: live shots taken in discharged industrial sites, CGI animations, tracking and motion captures, besides various other analogical ones.

American Jeff Ensign, aka Evolution Noise Slave composed the original sound track, which has been progressively updated during the video production. The musical score was inspired by 6 separate pieces Jeff had previously created that were then combined into a hybrid. The composition was also based in part from a sonic interpretation of the ideas presented in Antonin Artaud&rsquo;s the Theater and Cruelty overlaid on Bavari&rsquo;s images.

JURY STATEMENT FROM PRIX ARS ELECTRONICA 2011.

Alessandro Bavari&rsquo;s &ldquo;Metachaos&rdquo; is an impressive display of the amazing graphics that can be produced with leading-edge hardware and software. The 8-minute clip begins with a sequence of clear, geometric forms that suggest a serene world. But it doesn&rsquo;t take long until it&rsquo;s apparent that this was just the calm before the storm. Shadowy creatures and shockingly grotesque figures intrude into this domain rendered in black & white and sepia tones and rip it to pieces. Using the interplay of light and shadow, intentionally shaky camera movements and quick cuts, Bavari takes us on a tour de force through an unsettling imaginary cosmos that grips viewers and doesn&rsquo;t let them loose. In addition to its extraordinary visuals, &ldquo;Metachaos&rdquo; features an impressive composed soundscape of incredibly concentrated intensity&mdash;noise elements paired with driving beats, panic-stricken screams, the rattling of bones and gale-force winds.

While some of as did not necessarily share the apocalyptic view of this film, we found that it left the most indelible impression. Narrowly passing through the first round, it grew on us, so that on repeated viewing it miraculously made its way to the top.
What starts as a cinematic, kinetik, yet clean field of geometry and bodies, gradually evolves, or devolves, into the artist&rsquo;s vision of a nightmarish black-and-white world created by a continual collision of the human and the architectural form. It finally culminates in a screaming dance among the ruins. In a impressive virtuoso tour de force, Alessandro Bavari creates a constant m&ecirc;l&eacute;e of grime, projectile muck and dust among collapsing spaces at the stage for metamorphosing human bodies with branching limbs that seem constantly to break the architectural environment apart. Zombies with missing limb sand decaying skin and faces sometimes stand around listlessly and other times appear to engage in orgasmic sex. The human forms become insect-like and multiply in hordes across the building forms. Dust particles and snakes of turbolent, ferrous liquid finally explode into an apocalyptic ocean of flotsam and sludge.
Bavari&rsquo;s few collaborators helped shape what the credit call &ldquo;camera tremula&rdquo; (shaky, documentary-style camera) and sound design. We commend his dedication to a singular artistic vision that is grounded in his practice as a photographer. This is a representation of a caustic end of the world, a world of a audible pain and hopeless destruction rendered with a disturbing reference to 80s-style computer-generated animation as well as 60s &ldquo;actionism&rdquo;.

TITLE :Without a Doubt - Trailer
AUTHOR :Gerald Guthrie
LICENSE :cc0
YEAR :01/01/1970
DESCRIPTION :'Without a Doubt' is a digital animation that illustrates one variation on the 17th century philosopher Rene Descartes' view of the world. This time-based visual metaphor draws together Descartes' understanding of geometry, expressly the invention of the Cartesian co-ordinates (X,Y,Z), and his most famous statement, 'I think, therefore I am,' to create an introspective dimension within our own understanding.

DESCRIPTION :A miniature look to the catalan province of Girona.

Directed by Pau Garcia Laita.

Music by Cameron Ernst - Three.
Licensed by www.themusicbed.com

On May 2014 the Catalan Tourist Board organized a social media action in which 5 different artists were invited to spend a week through a province of Catalonia shooting with their own style. This is the result of tiltshifting the province of Girona, probably the one that has the most variety of geographical and landscape locations, where I tried to show the different lifestyles people have with a summertime feeling.

Locations in order of appearance: Cadaqu&eacute;s, Vall de N&uacute;ria, Ribes de Freser, Calella de Palafrugell, Llafranc, Sa Tuna, La Garrotxa, Banyoles, Besal&uacute;, Castellfollit de la Roca, Camprodon, Ripoll, Portbou, Estartit, Girona, Puigcerd&agrave;, La Cerdanya, La Molina, Cadaqu&eacute;s, Port Lligat, Monestir de Sant Pere de Rodes, El Port de la Selva, La Selva de Mar, Figueres, Sant Antoni de Calonge, Tamariu, Vall de N&uacute;ria, Palam&oacute;s, Tossa de Mar, Illes Medes.

YEAR :01/01/1970
DESCRIPTION :The big idea: Many search for it, few find it &ndash; and just a fraction of them implement it successfully.&nbsp;When enterprises search for innovation, the process becomes even more complex. Two professors&nbsp;from Stanford addressed this problem and found the solution in the Stone Age: Even our&nbsp;prehistoric ancestors were more efficient in achieving progress when they followed three simple&nbsp;rules that still apply today.

The Swiss insurance company "Die Mobiliar" asked us to visualize this &raquo;Hunter and Gatherer&laquo;&nbsp;method for training purposes in a short and entertaining way.

TITLE :Aygaz - Step into Future
AUTHOR :Büyük Ayı
LICENSE :Attribution-NonCommercial License
YEAR :01/01/1970
DESCRIPTION :Around April this year we started sketching out various space capsule designs based on the brief coming from the agency. It was for a roadshow that an automotive LPG company called Aygaz going for. The idea was capturing audience attention on the field with an unexpected object, a space capsule coming from the future with a message in it. The message was composed of three key future projections; Climate Change, Health and Economics. Story focus and our goal was to rise awareness and target emotional, perceptual experience.

On 21st of May we had approval on capsule designs, materials, construction plans, key visuals and concept overall. Except we had no storyboard and two months to deliver the thing on field. To cover up roughly we built a 4 meters long, 2.3 meters wide and 2.2 meters high made of aluminum space capsule looking experience area. We planted five LCD TV&rsquo;s inside, three of them were the main screens which was feed by a multitouch application streaming 3240 x 1920 pixels of data and two of them were on the sides acting as control panel, status updates and fictional settings. Again on both sides we had 8 highlighted subjects in seven segment displays. Displaying realtime numbers of deaths today, births today, deaths caused by cancer and deaths caused by hunger for instance.

Each topic had 35 to 45 seconds of animation content to narrate the story, at the end of each scene, users faced with an interactive 3d world geometry to go through the details of just explained. For example after the Climate Change scene an interactive scenario opens up to let user browse the drastic escalation of carbon dioxide and nitrogen emission between 1956 to 2056. Throughout the story every crucial detailed data was mined from various articles, reports, future projections and documentaries.

Overall journey actually starts with a push of a button on the back side of the space capsule. When button kicks in an automatic door opens up while sending a signal to an Arduino board which triggers another Arduino board with two real time clocks to light up seven segments. Another signal goes to main PC which runs the multitouch application and video feed to initialize the welcome screen. Third signal going from the main Arduino board to the second PC which runs the side screens. Fourth signal goes to led control panel for lighting the ceiling which is responsive to the current content playing on main screens which makes led control panel synced in realtime to the main pc. Yes it was a complicated setup and in the end we found our self controlling every bit with a network of Arduino&rsquo;s talking each other even when logging out from the capsule. There is a button inside which is yellow by the way, when you press that button, automatic doors opens up, system shuts down and CCTV stops operating until the next push from outside.

After 52 days of sleepless nights, lots of calories and chain of events ruled by Murphy we delivered the space capsule on time for the roadshow. It was a huge experience for all of us and full of education on every step of it.

TITLE :VFX Showreel HD - Mospeada Upgrade
AUTHOR :Joseph Yeo
LICENSE :Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs License
YEAR :01/01/1970
DESCRIPTION :Hi, I'm Joseph Yeo from South Korea. This is my very first piece which took over a year to complete.

The primary inspiration was drawn from a Japanese animation called, "Mospeda (1983)", and the work can be viewed online at http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f4qyhqEp_Xw
My personal attempts have been made to reinterpret and advance various aspects of the original piece to present a 3D work.

The scene is based on a premise that a vehicle is transformed and reconfigured around the main character's armor after being dispatched to a crime scene with an alarm of a presence of a robbery at a bank.

The wireframe scenes are shown with a concept of requesting personal information in a police security database.

I would like to create sensational and creative videos which can touch people's hearts. I love CGI

Thank you so much for your time and watching my video :)

We really enjoyed working on this beautiful film from Elias. Here's some words from him

"Design Starts Here is my graduation project for the MA Graphic Moving Image course at London College of Communication. From my research into the motion design and graphic design industries, I have often discovered that many people place too much of an emphasis on software. I wanted to express in my short film how good design is in fact about coming up with ideas &ndash; that often start from pencil and paper &ndash; not just the tools at your disposal."

"A cosmonaut was sent to repair an old satellite. He just finished his mission when..."

This is not a sequel to 2001 : A Space Odyssey but some kind of tribute to the book. The story of C. Clarke was supposed to take place exactly ten years ago. 2001 to 2011, I thought it was a good date to make something, even if it has no obvious relation with the original story.

"Un cosmonaute a ete envoye pour reparer un vieux satellite. Il vient de terminer sa mission lorsque..."

Ceci n'est pas une suite a 2001 : L'Odyssee de l'Espace mais une sorte d'hommage au livre. L'histoire de l'oeuvre de C. Clarke etait supposee avoir lieu il y a exactement dix ans cette ann&eacute;e. 2001 a 2011, j'ai pense que c'etait une bonne date pour marquer le coup, meme si ma creation n'a finalement rien a voir avec l'histoire originale.

TITLE :Bakker Nixvan
AUTHOR :Bakker Nixvan

YEAR :01/01/1970
DESCRIPTION :Bakker Nixvan is a short animation about the struggles of an amusingly incompetent baker who by laziness and impatience sabotages his own actions everywhere he goes.

Bakker Nixvan has been created by four second year students at the Utrecht School of Art and Technology. This was the first time any of us tried to do anything like this. Even though there was an obvious lack of time we're still proud of the end result. We've learned a LOT after all!

TITLE :Dalia Kornblit
AUTHOR :Yair Walden
LICENSE :Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs License
YEAR :01/01/1970
DESCRIPTION :"I'm Sitting on a chair and building a small circus on the table, give me a kiss, i want you to be healthy and happy"

This quote is from a letter that a 5 year old girl wrote to her cousin during the Holocaust. the small Jewish girl survived the Holocaust while staying with a christian friends of her family, probably without knowing who is her real mother. she wrote to her cousin frequently, but only after the war when she and her mother we're reunited again, she realized she was actually writing to her mother all that time.

This story is her survival story, with the loss of her identity for the chance to survive the war.

Inspired by her letters, I chose to show her story from a little girl's naive point of view. as she experienced the Holocaust in a very unique way.


Made in collaboration with "Yad Vashem" ,the Jewish Holocaust Martyrs' and Heroes' Remembrance Authority.

DESCRIPTION :Researching character animation with fbx motion data in Cinema 4D.

You can download the c4d project file here:
http://www.kenottmann.com/category/downloads
http://www.kenottmann.com/2016/03/blog-virtual-dancer-animation/

I got a lot of requests for the c4d source files of my Particle Systems II animation (http://goo.gl/GffYhk).
Finally I found some time to collect a downloadable package including some of the used techniques (TurbulenceFD, Hair, Cloner).

The motion data is based on a free Mixamo test pack (https://www.mixamo.com/) and was imported into Cinema 4D as fbx file.
You can find a lot of tutorials on how to import fbx data and merge it with your own project on youtube (e.g. https://goo.gl/5BSS70).

Have fun with it!

DESCRIPTION :While working in house for Thomson Reuters I created this promo for their global campaign to promote Eikon. This is their flagship financial product and the promo was rolled out globally with multi language versions also created. The project was a Cinema 4D and After Effects workflow with the User Interfaces being created by the Visual Designers who actually created the working software. This was a huge project, and required masses of render power and organisation in order to hit the launch deadline.

Ce g&eacute;n&eacute;rique conceptualis&eacute; et r&eacute;alis&eacute; par Vincent Venchiarutti chez Mikros Image montre une galerie de personnages qui "sombrent" lentement. 
Il a pour but de plonger le spectateur d&eacute;s le d&eacute;part dans l'ambiance pesante de cette s&eacute;rie.

Synopsis

Victime d&rsquo;hallucinations puissantes, il apprend qu&rsquo;il est atteint d&rsquo;une maladie neurologique mortelle, alors que, dans Paris, un nouveau narcotrafiquant prend de l&rsquo;ampleur. Celui-ci, Guillaume Leanour, concocte un nouveau &ldquo;speed&rdquo; qui inondera la capitale gr&acirc;ce &agrave; ses vendeurs, recrut&eacute;s parmi des sans-papiers. Humili&eacute; par un coll&egrave;gue, Michel Serrero demande &agrave; devenir l&rsquo;un des agents infiltr&eacute;s qui pistent Leanour, au sein d&rsquo;une &eacute;quipe de choc coordonn&eacute;e par la &ldquo;Reine&rdquo;.

TITLE :Homage to "Skyfall" title sequence
AUTHOR :heebok lee
LICENSE :Attribution License
YEAR :01/01/1970
DESCRIPTION :007 is one of the most successful movie franchises in film history. In&nbsp;addition&nbsp;to its success, the design of the title sequence is as attractive as its story of a secret agent. From the title sequence of "Dr. No" designed by Maurice Binder in 1962 to&nbsp;the recent "Skyfall" by Daniel Kleinman, its design has been sexy, provocative, and high art-a dream job for designers.

As a huge fan of&nbsp;the 007 title sequences, I&rsquo;ve always thought about creating my version of one. After watching &ldquo;Skyfall&rdquo; in 2012, I decided to create an homage to the sequence and in 2013 I began building a team with the help of&nbsp;my&nbsp;producers&nbsp;and&nbsp;friends&nbsp;Soyoung Kim and Jin Seo. We pulled all the strings to find talent, a&nbsp;choreographer, a&nbsp;stylist, a&nbsp;DP, and&nbsp;a VFX company. After several months, we were able to assemble a great team. I was&nbsp;especially lucky to have Claudia Kim from "Avengers: &nbsp;Age of Ultron"&nbsp;(2015) as the main talent and Soojin Choi, one of the best dancers in Korea, as the choreographer. After all the obstacles we&rsquo;ve encountered&nbsp;in the process over the last two and a half years, we&rsquo;re happy to finally&nbsp;finish it and share it with you today.

Regarding the title sequence, we kept the original song by Adele and the general concept&nbsp;of&nbsp;the death experience of James Bond. However, while the original sequence was more focused on his out-of-body experience, we focused more on the temptation of death: he reaches the bottom of the pit, struggles internally, and is lured into death. In the end, he regains himself and stands strong from his inner battle. We also added a touch of fashion film to enhance the look of the&nbsp;female talent.

Enjoy the film and all comments are welcome!

How many National Parks have you visited before? Have you ever been to Yosemite, Yellowstone, Olympic, Banff, Kings Canyon, Sequoia, Acadia, Rocky Mountains, Mesa Verde, Arches, Mount Rainier, Mount Revelstoke and Zion in less than ten minutes?

Join us on the ferry in the Seattle bay, come with us to sunrise and sunset at the magic golden gate bridge. Visit Los Angeles, Vancouver, St. Louis, San Francisco and Las Vegas at night. Did we mention Mount Rushmore NM? New Orleans? Especially the sunset at Toronto from top of the CN Tower? &bdquo;Smaller&ldquo; spots like Boston, Calgary, Springdale, Three Rivers, Pagosa Springs, Swift Current?

You travel to the Griffith Observatory, the Empire State Building, the One World Trade Center during construction, Manhattan, Tongue Point &hellip; and so many more.

Not enough? What about Niagara Falls, Lake Palourde, Keene Lake, Horseshoe Bend, White Mountains, Hobson CP and the Mississippi River?

Visit Alberta, Arizona, Arkansas, British Columbia, California and Colorado, Illinois, Louisiana, New Hampshire, New York, Nevada, Massachusetts and Maine, Missouri, Ontario, Oregon, Saskatchewan, South Dakota, Utah, Washington and Wyoming.

Three years - three months - three trips - now we show the best. One of the longest timelapses perhaps - we call it the EPIC :) And that was the trip. More than 10.000 km each year - a great mix of landscapes and cityscapes - absolutely amazing!

Thanks for the fantastic soundtrack and mix to Kriz Mental http://homecookin.de and his drummer Lu Kleff.
Thanks to Alex for the title design and for polishing the graphics. Thanks to Stef for her support - she is the best camera assistant with a lot of patience for this time consuming job - love you!

The next journey will start soon &hellip; and it will be 8K! 

Many thanks to all of you for supporting this project - not with money - but for building such great hard- and software! Thanks to @emotimo and @dynamicperception for your great tools. Thank you to Canon - your 5D MK II and 5D MK III have done more than 100.000 pictures for that journey through North America. Lenses used are the Canon EOS 24-70mm 2.8 and 24-70 2.8 II, 100mm 2.8 macro and 70-200mm 2.8 II and the Samyang 14mm 2.8. We used Lightroom and especially LR Timelapse for postproduction (V4 rescued the opening sequence!). Final editing with Adobe Premiere Pro. Title design with Adobe After Effects.

--------------------------------

Schau Dir die Lichter der Nacht &uuml;ber New York City vom Dach des Empire State Buildings an, f&uuml;hle den k&uuml;hlen Wind in Chicago Ende Oktober und wenn Du nur richtig hinh&ouml;rst, kannst Du den Klang der Cable Cars h&ouml;ren, auf unserer Fahrt durch Down Town San Francisco. Du magst es? - wir lieben es!

Wieviele National Parks hast du bisher besucht? Warst du je in Yosemite, Yellowstone, Olympic, Banff, Kings Canyon, Sequoia, Acadia, Rocky Mountains, Mesa Verde, Arches, Mount Rainier, Mount Revelstoke und Zion in insgesamt weniger als zehn Minuten?

Begleite uns auf unserer F&auml;hrfahrt durch die Bucht von Seattle, komm mit uns zum Sonnenauf- und Sonnenuntergang zur zauberhaften Golden Gate Bridge. Besuche Los Angeles, Vancouver, St. Louis, San Francisco und Las Vegas in nur einer Nacht. Haben wir schon das Mount Rushmore National Monument erw&auml;hnt? Und New Orleans? Vorallem den Sonnenuntergang in Toronto von der Spitze des CN Towers? Oder auch "kleinere" Ziele wie Boston, Calgary, Springdale, Three Rivers, Pagosa Springs, Swift Current?

Wir nehmen Dich mit auf eine Reise zum Griffith Observatory in LA, zum Empire State Building, zum One World Trade Center w&auml;hrend der Erbauung, nach Manhattan, zum Tongue Point &hellip; und so vielem mehr.

Das reicht Dir noch nicht? Was ist mit den Niagara F&auml;llen, Lake Palourde, Keene Lake, Horseshoe Bend, White Mountains, Hobson CP und dem Mississippi?

Besuche Alberta, Arizona, Arkansas, British Columbia, California und Colorado, Illinois, Louisiana, New Hampshire, New York, Nevada, Massachusetts und Maine, Missouri, Ontario, Oregon, Saskatchewan, South Dakota, Utah, Washington und Wyoming.

Drei Jahre - drei Monate - drei Reisen - und nun zeigen wir Dir das Beste davon. Sicher, es ist eher einer der l&auml;ngeren Timelapse - wir nennen ihn "das Epos"! :) Mit mehr als 10.000 km jedes Jahr und einer gro&szlig;artigen Mischung aus Landschaften und St&auml;dten - absolut unglaublich und atemberaubend!

Die n&auml;chste Reise startet schon bald ... dann produzieren wir in 8K!

TITLE :Controller Evolution v.2
AUTHOR :Chris Koelsch
LICENSE :Attribution License
YEAR :01/01/1970
DESCRIPTION :Nintendo always has been and always will be a constant element in my life. This piece is a tribute to their life thus far.  

I said this over a year ago when I made the first Controller Evolution, and now with the introduction of the Wii U it only seemed fitting to continue this tradition.  I can't think of a better controller's history to track than Nintendo's.  The changes have been so dramatic yet so subtle all at the same time. You really don't notice that until your animating every little piece.

To read Controller Evolution v. 2 and the Evolution of an Animator, check out my blog here:

DESCRIPTION :" At the very end of all things, like in the first beginning, No one knows
Everything is about to be written.

So, slowly, the vail of illusion fades out.

Thoughts and memories mix up, an immutable dance of time, space, shadow and light, and in the core of vacuity, the invisible world rebirth.

The world that never was. "



Teaser for a short movie I'm working on for months now on my personal free time.
Still a lot of work to do...
Hope to release a Final cut on the fall 2011

After so many hours working on it, just sharing some of the shots ! Hope you will like the mood of the "invisible"

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the beginning there was a choice. 
This choice was in spite of everything instilled in our creation. The A.I.
And it was this same choice which has destroyed us.

The fear.

But there is one last hope...

Norsk is one of the possible narratives of our future, where there is a slim hope into the depths of this story.
Reflection of a selfish society, which in its progress has forgotten its own human values.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Au commencement, il y eut un choix.
Ce choix fut en d&eacute;pit de tout instill&eacute; dans nos cr&eacute;ation. Les I.A.
Et c'est ce m&ecirc;me choix qui nous a d&eacute;truits.

La Peur.

Mais il existe un dernier espoir...

Norsk est l'un des r&eacute;cits possibles de notre avenir, celui o&ugrave; r&eacute;side un mince espoir dans les profondeurs de cette histoire. 
Reflet d'une soci&eacute;t&eacute; &eacute;go&iuml;ste, qui dans son progr&egrave;s en a oubli&eacute;e ses propres valeurs humaines.

DESCRIPTION :if you like it leave a comment...and share...
The large majority of today&acute;s dairy farms haven&acute;t got anything to do with lush meadows and chilling cows. Calves are taken away from their mothers directly after birth and scream out horrified for days. Cows are massively over-bred so they give more than three times more milk as they would normally,  with  disastrous results for the health of their bodies. If their milk yield goes down, they get impregnated again, after four or five years they are inefficient and get slaughtered, normally a cow lives for 25 years. Three out of four of their calves get slaughtered in their first years, because they are just a byproduct for the milk production. One of them will have to come after its mother.

For those  who think that without milk and meat you suffer insufficient nutrition for building muscles and so on, there are funny guys around who prove otherwise:

DESCRIPTION :The rubrics cube attempts to escape from its eternal riddle. It transforms into a robot and through changing its movement axis, runs. However, that's not enough for it to escape the universe that entraps it. It turns into Tetris  bricks, but their total lacks one, resulting into a transformation back to itself.

The only tool used for the construction of this animation is after fx. I used after fx more as a trial for myself but also to test its boundaries as a program. No 3D objects where used. They are all constructed with masks that are parent on the masks used as a movement axis.

The video was hosted as loop in the "iskate", an interactive installation, at 7ply project 2007

DESCRIPTION :EN: The main idea was to showcase Russia, its history, its people, their inventions and what Russia has already left and continues to leave as its own mark on the entire world via the unique Russian alphabet, and what people in other countries, even Russians themselves sometimes do not even recognize as their very own. 
 
We used lots of different visual techniques to complete this patchwork blanket into a complete whole as much as it was realistically possible, as the palette of events, people, things and concepts were dispersed as massively and diversely and sometimes as much contradictory as Russia itself. 
 
We chose the technology of fully synthetic image, full CG, except for the lead-girl and a few other details to even brighter and more convexly showcase this unusual journey. 
 
Spasibo!

TITLE :Left-brained Larry & Right-brained Rachel
AUTHOR :Niels Michael Wee
LICENSE :Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs License
YEAR :01/01/1970
DESCRIPTION :Synopsis
This is the tale of Left-brained Larry & Right-brained Rachel, a Siamese twin couple, stuck
together by the head and thus resulting in them sharing only one brain. Using exactly fifty percent
each, their separate personalities are kept intact and following the theory, being either left- or rightbrained, Larry and Rachel are complete opposites. They have a hard time being stuck together with their counterpart, but not only do they hate each other, their abnormality also makes them dislikable to the people around them, leaving them with a melancholy life of bullying and parental neglect.
One thing the couple shares though is a common hatred and a longing for revenge.
The opportunity arrives when they find out that using the whole brain at once might give them
supernatural powers that can help rid them of their enemies. But the tragic lesson is learned: Being
so opposite their team work is doomed to go terribly wrong.

The Script
I've had the idea for this story for a couple of years before I came to the European Film College
(EFC). I've always been very interested in how the brain works and how intelligence can be
categorized between individuals and at the time I had recently read what is now my favourite book,
The Melancholy Death of Oyster Boy and other stories by my number one idol Tim Burton.
Influenced by the style of this book, mixed with philosophies of left- and right-brained theories, the
characters of Larry and Rachel came to me out of thin air.

I drew my first sketch of the characters and played around with some rhymes but didn't get much
further at the time. I've always had a small dream of doing stop motion, so it wasn't until the
opportunity arose at the school that I decided to take up the idea once again. Eventually I submitted
it for the Final Projects and was extremely happy when it got chosen amongst the around seventy
scripts submitted.
Today the theories are quite outdated, but I decided that this wasn't supposed to be a story of realism afterall. The concept worked brilliantly though: From this very black and white way of looking at the world, the personalities of Larry and Rachel were strictly set from the beginning and it was easy to figure out how each of them would think in any given situation. The plot came from the idea of Larry and Rachel joining forces to get revenge on the people who had treated them badly whilst growing up. By mixing brainwaves Larry and Rachel could get supernatural powers. Knowing how opposite they are though, the ending was just as clear to me from the beginning.
I enjoyed writing this script and hope to write many more just like it. Stylistically it's very
influenced by the works of Tim Burton and even Edaward Gorey who inspired him. I regard this
project as the first step on my way to finding my own unique style; a mix of all the details I love so.

The production
For four weeks we worked and lived in the common room of the Blue House at the EFC and hardly
saw the sunshine that was right outside the huge black curtain that was to be constantly closed for
light continuity reasons. A total of twenty sets of hands pitched in, all contributing with a great dose
of creativity. Some would merely join us for an afternoon of propmaking when they had free time
from other projects, others were full time members which gave us a core crew of seven people who
worked from 9 am to 11pm every day.
The film was made as one of the 16 Final Projects to culminate our school year at the EFC &ndash; being
the only animation film.
This film is definitely the result of an incredible effort and most importantly: Great management.
Because of a cool overview and control we managed to keep the deadline. There were many
challenges along the way, but they were always solved with creativity and hard work.
I feel extremely fortunate to have worked with such a hardworking bunch of people who not only
transferred my script and drawings to an exact replica of what I had envisioned in my mind, but
always added such a fine dose of humor and detail.

Tech Specs: 1920 x 800 24 FPS
Software used:
Modo for 3D modelling of syringe, heart, lungs, brain. 
Photoshop for illustration and animation.
Combination of After Effects and Nuke for compositing and various post effects.
Premiere for Sound Design.

Sound Design: Kane Rowlingson, Callan Woolcock
Concept: Jumbla

Note from Creative Director
I wanted to try something I hadn&rsquo;t done before, or had very little knowledge about how to do it. 3D animation isn&rsquo;t my background, and I&rsquo;ve never animated in Photoshop before. So I guess, why not try both at once? Oh yeah, and we hadn&rsquo;t really tried sound design to this level either, so thought we&rsquo;d give that a shot to. What a journey! Over a month and a half of hard work and dedication, basically animating every night and every weekend for about 6 weeks, and learning various software and new techniques along the way. I just hope everyone likes what we&rsquo;ve done! Also don&rsquo;t do drugs, or your heart will turn into a fish.

TITLE :Aygaz - Step into Future / Making Of
AUTHOR :Büyük Ayı
LICENSE :Attribution-NonCommercial License
YEAR :01/01/1970
DESCRIPTION :Around April this year we started sketching out various space capsule designs based on the brief coming from the agency. It was for a roadshow that an automotive LPG company called Aygaz going for. The idea was capturing audience attention on the field with an unexpected object, a space capsule coming from the future with a message in it. The message was composed of three key future projections; Climate Change, Health and Economics. Story focus and our goal was to rise awareness and target emotional, perceptual experience.

On 21st of May we had approval on capsule designs, materials, construction plans, key visuals and concept overall. Except we had no storyboard and two months to deliver the thing on field. To cover up roughly we built a 4 meters long, 2.3 meters wide and 2.2 meters high made of aluminum space capsule looking experience area. We planted five LCD TV&rsquo;s inside, three of them were the main screens which was feed by a multitouch application streaming 3240 x 1920 pixels of data and two of them were on the sides acting as control panel, status updates and fictional settings. Again on both sides we had 8 highlighted subjects in seven segment displays. Displaying realtime numbers of deaths today, births today, deaths caused by cancer and deaths caused by hunger for instance.

Each topic had 35 to 45 seconds of animation content to narrate the story, at the end of each scene, users faced with an interactive 3d world geometry to go through the details of just explained. For example after the Climate Change scene an interactive scenario opens up to let user browse the drastic escalation of carbon dioxide and nitrogen emission between 1956 to 2056. Throughout the story every crucial detailed data was mined from various articles, reports, future projections and documentaries.

Overall journey actually starts with a push of a button on the back side of the space capsule. When button kicks in an automatic door opens up while sending a signal to an Arduino board which triggers another Arduino board with two real time clocks to light up seven segments. Another signal goes to main PC which runs the multitouch application and video feed to initialize the welcome screen. Third signal going from the main Arduino board to the second PC which runs the side screens. Fourth signal goes to led control panel for lighting the ceiling which is responsive to the current content playing on main screens which makes led control panel synced in realtime to the main pc. Yes it was a complicated setup and in the end we found our self controlling every bit with a network of Arduino&rsquo;s talking each other even when logging out from the capsule. There is a button inside which is yellow by the way, when you press that button, automatic doors opens up, system shuts down and CCTV stops operating until the next push from outside.

After 52 days of sleepless nights, lots of calories and chain of events ruled by Murphy we delivered the space capsule on time for the roadshow. It was a huge experience for all of us and full of education on every step of it. 

In the mean time this is the animation content excluding multitouch scenes https://vimeo.com/113586205

DESCRIPTION :Sometimes we tend to overlook the significant things in life.
Like how Newton discovered gravity from a falling apple.

Millions saw the apple fall, but Newton was the one who asked why.  
- Bernard Baruch -

Spend time to take a step back and find the true value of that apple.

TITLE :Kobo Aura One Director's Cut
AUTHOR :Jeff Briant
LICENSE :Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivs License
YEAR :01/01/1970
DESCRIPTION :Over the summer of 2016 Asterisk Media commissioned the team to create a video for Kobo's latest e-reader, the Aura One.  The idea here was to create a visual portal into an easy to use device that would take you to far away places, unheard of adventures and beautiful worlds. As a small team with a very tight production schedule we were able to iterate quickly on a series of demanding renders and delivered dozens of localized versions. The resulting work that the team presented to the client was used as the launch video introducing the Kobo Aura One.
